Appendix II: Django Class-Based Views
-------------------------------------

This appendix follows on from Chapter 9, in which we implemented Django forms
for validation, and refactored our views.  By the end of that chapter, our
views were still using functions.

The new shiny in the Django world, however, is class-based views. In this
chapter, we'll refactor our application to use them instead of view functions.
More specifically, we'll have a go at using class-based 'generic' views.

WARNING: this appendix is currently more of a blog post / request for comments
than a final appendix.  Use at your own peril.

Class-based generic views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's worth making a distinction at this point, between class-based views and
class-based 'generic' views.  Class-based views are just another way of
defining view functions.  They make few assumptions about what your views will
do, and they offer one major benefit over view functions, which is that they
can be subclassed.  This comes, arguably, at the expense of being less readable
than traditional function-based views.  The main use case for 'plain'
class-based views is when you have several views that re-use the same logic.
We want to obey the DRY principle. With function-based views, you would use
helper functions or decorators.  The theory is that using a class structure may
give you a more elegant solution.

Class-based 'generic' views are class-based views that attempt to provide
ready-made solutions to common use cases:  fetching an object from the
database and passing it to a template, fetching a list of objects, saving
user input from a POST request using a ModelForm, and so on.  These sound very
much like our use cases, but as we'll soon see, the devil is in the detail.

I should say at this point that I've not used either kind of class-based views
much. I can definitely see the sense in them, and there are potentially many
use cases in Django apps where CBGVs would fit in perfectly. However, as soon
as your use case is slightly outside the basics -- as soon as you have more
than one model you want to use, for example, I've found that using class-based
views becomes much more complicated, and you end up with code that's harder to
read than a classic view function.  

Still, because we're forced to use a lot of the customisation options for
class-based views, implementing them in this case can teach us a lot about
how they work, and how we can unit tests them.

My hope is that the same unit tests we use for function-based views should
work just as well for class-based views.  Let's see how we get on.


The home page as a FormView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our home page just displays a form on a template:

[source,python]
----
def home_page(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'form': ItemForm()})
----

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/[Looking through
the options], Django has a generic view called `FormView` -- let's see how that
goes:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch21l001)
[source,python]
----
from django.views.generic import FormView
[...]

class HomePageView(FormView):
    template_name = 'home.html'
    form_class = ItemForm
----

We tell it what template we want to use, and which form. Then, we
just need to update 'urls.py', replacing the line that used to say
`lists.views.home_page`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py (ch21l002)
[source,python]
----
    url(r'^$', HomePageView.as_view(), name='home'),
----

And the tests all check out! That was easy..

----
$ python3 manage.py test lists
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
......................
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 22 tests in 0.134s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...

$ python3 manage.py test functional_tests
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
....
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 15.160s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

So far so good. We've replaced a 1-line view function with a 2-line class,
but it's still very readable. This would be a good time for a commit...

Using form_valid to customise a CreateView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we have a crack at the view we use to create a brand new list, currently
the `new_list` function.  Looking through the possible CBGVs, we
probably want a `CreateView`, and we know we're using the `ItemForm` class,
so let's see how we get on with them, and whether the tests will help us:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView):
    form_class = ItemForm

def new_list(request):
    form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['text'], list=list)
        return redirect(list)
    else:
        return render(request, 'home.html', {"form": form})
----

I'm going to leave the old view function in 'views.py', so that we can copy
code across from it.  We can delete it once everything is working.  It's
harmless as soon as we switch over the URL mappings, this time in:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
    url(r'^new$', NewListView.as_view(), name='new_list'),
----

Now running the tests gives 3 errors:

----
$ python3 manage.py test lists
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
...................EEE

TODO: talk through decoding traceback.

Let's start with the third -- maybe we can just add the template?

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView):
    form_class = ItemForm
    template_name = 'home.html'
----

That gets us down to just two failures.  They're both to do with dealing
with 'valid' POST requests.  CBGVs that deal with forms want you to put
any custom code for valid forms in a method called `form_valid`.  We can 
just copy across some of the code from the old view function:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView):
    template_name = 'home.html'
    form_class = ItemForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text=form.cleaned_data['text'], list=list)
        return redirect(list)
----

That gets us a pass!

----
$ python3 manage.py test lists
Ran 22 tests in 0.117s
OK
$ python3 manage.py test functional_tests
Ran 4 tests in 15.157s
OK
----

And we can even save two lines (DRY) by taking advantage of the real point of
CBVs: inheritance!

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView, HomePageView):

    def form_valid(self, form):
        list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text=form.cleaned_data['text'], list=list)
        return redirect('/lists/%d/' % (list.id,))
----


And all the tests still pass.

How does it compare to the old version? I'd say that's not bad.   We save some
boilerplate code, and the view is still fairly legible.  So far, I'd say we've
got one point for CBGVs, and one draw.


A more complex view to handle both viewing and adding to a list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This took me 'several' attempts.  And I have to say that, although the tests
told me when I got it right, they didn't really help me to figure out the
steps to get there...  Mostly it was just trial and error, hacking about
in functions like `get_context_data`, `get_form_kwargs` and so on.

One thing I did do which improved my codebase was to add a new unit test:

[source,python]
.lists/tests/test_views.py
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_list_view_displays_form_for_existing_lists(self):
        correct_list = List.objects.create()
        response = self.client.get('/lists/%d/' % (correct_list.id,))
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context['form'], ExistingListItemForm)
----

It's another good example of the "each test should test one thing" heuristic:
that check on the form class could very easily have been tacked onto the end
of a different test, but having it separate means I'm immediately told exactly
what's wrong, rather than potentially having the error masked by an earlier 
failure.

TODO: consider moving this test into ch. 9?


Anyway, after much hacking and swearing, this is the solution I eventually got
to work:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class ViewAndAddToList(CreateView, SingleObjectMixin):
    template_name = 'list.html'
    model = List
    form_class = ExistingListItemForm

    def get_form(self, form_class):
        self.object = self.get_object()
        if self.request.method == 'POST':
            data={
                'text': self.request.POST['text'],
                'list': self.object.id
            }
        else:
            data = None
        return form_class(data=data)
----

I also had to add a `get_absolute_url` on the `Item` class:

(I did try to use `get_form_kwargs` instead of `get_form`, but it didn't want
to work for me.  Perhaps some CBGV expert out there has a neater solution??)

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    [...]

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return self.list.get_absolute_url()
----


Compare old and new
+++++++++++++++++++

Let's see the old version for comparison?

[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    list = List.objects.get(id=list_id)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ExistingListItemForm(data={
            'text': request.POST['text'],
            'list': list.id
        })
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect(list)
    else:
        form = ExistingListItemForm()

    return render(request, 'list.html', {'list': list, "form": form})
----

Not a great improvement.  Same number of lines of code, 15.  If anything, the
function version is better because it has one more line of whitespace. And it's
definitely more readable.



Best practices for unit testing CBGVs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As I was working through this, I felt like my "unit" tests were sometimes a 
little too high-level.  They told me whether I was getting things right or
wrong, but they didn't offer many clues on exactly how to fix things.

I occasionally wondered whether there might be some mileage in a test that
was closer to the implementation -- something like this:

[source,python]
----
def test_as_cbv(self):
    our_list = List.objects.create()
    view = ViewAndAddToList()
    view.kwargs = dict(pk=our_list.id)
    self.assertEqual(view.get_object(), our_list)
----

But the problem is that it requires a lot of knowledge of the internals of
Django CBVs to be able to do the right test setup for these kinds of tests.
And you still end up getting very confused by the complex inheritance 
hierarchy.

I'd be interested to hear how other people out there are testing their CBVs?
