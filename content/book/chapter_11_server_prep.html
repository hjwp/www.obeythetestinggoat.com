<div class="paragraph">
<p>

We can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Provisioning</em> a new server to be able to host the code.
This includes choosing an operating system,
getting basic credentials to log in,
and configuring DNS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Deploying</em> our application to an existing server,
which includes getting our Docker image onto the server,
starting a container, and configuring it to talk to the database
and the outside world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infrastructure-as-code tools can let you automate both of these,
but the provisioning parts tend to be quite vendor-specific,
so for the purposes of this book, we can live with manual provisioning.</p>

I should probably stress once more that deployment is something that varies a lot,
  and that as a result there are few universal best practices for how to do it.
  So, rather than trying to remember the specifics of what I&#8217;m doing here,
  you should be trying to understand the rationale,
  so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the specific future circumstances you encounter.

<h4 id="_choosing_where_to_host_our_site">Choosing Where to Host Our Site</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
There are loads of different solutions out there these days,
but they broadly fall into two camps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Running your own (probably virtual) server, aka VPS (Virtual Private Server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)
offering like Heroku or my old employers, PythonAnywhere.

</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a PaaS, you don&#8217;t get your own server,
instead you&#8217;re renting a "service" at a higher level of abstraction.
Particularly for small sites,
a PaaS offers a lot of advantages over running your own server,
and I would definitely recommend looking into them.
We&#8217;re not going to use a PaaS in this book however, for several reasons.
The main reason is that I want to avoid endorsing specific commercial providers.
Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot&#8212;&#8203;learning about one
doesn&#8217;t necessarily tell you about the others.
Any one of them might radically change their process or business model by the time you get to read this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, we&#8217;ll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and manual debugging.
They&#8217;re unlikely to ever go away,
and knowing a bit about them will get you some respect
from all the grizzled dinosaurs out there.</p>

<h4 id="_spinning_up_our_own_server">Spinning Up Our Own Server</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not going to dictate how you spin up a server&#8212;&#8203;whether
you choose Amazon AWS, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, your own server in a data centre,
or a Raspberry Pi in a cupboard under the stairs,
any solution should be fine, as long as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your server is running Ubuntu 22.04 (aka "Jammy/LTS").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have root access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s on the public internet (ie, it has a public IP address).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can SSH into it (I recommend using a non-root user account,
with sudo access, and public/private key authentication)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m recommending Ubuntu as a distro:footnote[
Linux as an operating system comes in lots of different flavours,
called "distros" or "distributions".
The differences between them and their relative pros and cons are,
like any seemingly minor detail, of tremendous interest to the right kind of nerd.
We don&#8217;t need to care about them for this book. As I say, Ubuntu is fine.]
because it&#8217;s popular and I&#8217;m used to it.
If you know what you&#8217;re doing, you can probably get away with using
something else, but I won&#8217;t be able to help you as much if you get stuck.</p>

I appreciate that, if you&#8217;ve never started a Linux server before

this is a big ask, especially when I&#8217;m refusing to "dictate"
exactly how to do it.</p>

Some people get to this chapter, and are tempted to skip the domain bit,
    and the "getting a real server" bit, and just use a VM on their own PC.
    Don&#8217;t do this.
    It&#8217;s <em>not</em> the same, and you&#8217;ll have more difficulty following the instructions,

<div class="title">General Tip For Working With Infrastructure</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important lesson to remember over the next few chapters chapter is,
as always but more than ever, to work incrementally,
make one change at a time, and run your tests frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When things (inevitably) go wrong, resist the temptation to flail about
and make other unrelated changes in the hope that things will start working again;
instead, stop, go backward if necessary to get to a working state,
and figure out what went wrong before moving forward again.</p>

<h3 id="_getting_a_domain_name">Getting a Domain Name</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We&#8217;re going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book&#8212;&#8203;they
can both be subdomains of a single domain.
I&#8217;m going to use <em>superlists.ottg.co.uk</em> and <em>staging.ottg.co.uk</em>.
If you don&#8217;t already own a domain, this is the time to register one!
Again, this is something I really want you to <em>actually</em> do.
If you&#8217;ve never registered a domain before,
just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one&#8212;&#8203;it
should only cost you $5 or so,
and I promise seeing your site on a "real" website will be a thrill.</p>

<h3 id="_configuring_dns_for_staging_and_live_domains">Configuring DNS for Staging and Live Domains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time,
so we should point our staging and live domains to the server.
At my registrar, the control screens looked a bit like <a href="#registrar-control-screens">Domain setup</a>.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/gandi_add_dns_a_record.png" alt="Registrar control screen for adding a DNS record">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Domain setup</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is called an "A-Record".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
All registrars are slightly different,
but a bit of clicking around should get you to the right screen in yours.
You&#8217;ll need two A-records:
one for the staging address and one for the live one.
No need to worry about any other type of record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DNS records take some time to "propagate" around the world
(it&#8217;s controlled by a setting called "TTL", Time To Live),
so once you&#8217;ve set up your A-record,
you can check its progress on a "propagation checking" service like this one:

<h3 id="_ansible">Ansible</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infrastructure-as-code tools, also called "configuration management" tools,
come in lots of shapes and sizes.
Chef and Puppet were two of the original ones,
and you&#8217;ll probably come across Terraform,
which is particularly strong on managing cloud services like AWS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re going to use Ansible, because it&#8217;s relatively popular,
because it can do everything we need it to,
because I&#8217;m biased that it happens to be written in Python,
and because it&#8217;s probably the one I&#8217;m personally most familiar with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another tool could probably have worked just as well!
The main thing to remember is the <em>concept</em>, which is that,
as much as possible we want to manage our server configuration <em>declaratively</em>,
by expressing the desired state of the server in a particular configuration syntax,
rather than specifying a procedural series of steps to be followed one by one.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 2. Ansible and SSH</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our objective is to use Ansible to automate the process of deploying to our server:
making sure that the server has everything it needs to run our app
(mostly, Docker and our container image),
and then telling it to start or restart our container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now and again, we&#8217;ll want to "log on" to the server and have a look around manually:
for that, we&#8217;ll use the <code>ssh</code> command-line on our computer,
which can let us open up an interactive console on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll run our functional tests against the server, once it&#8217;s running our app,
to make sure it&#8217;s all working correctly.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_start_by_making_sure_we_can_ssh_in">Start by Making Sure We Can SSH In</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point and for the rest of the book,
I&#8217;m assuming that you have a nonroot user account set up,
and that it has "sudo" privileges,
so whenever we need to do something that requires root access, we use sudo,
(or "become" in Ansible terminology);
I&#8217;ll be explicit about that in the various instructions that follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My user is called "elspeth", but you can call yours whatever you like!
Just remember to substitute it in all the places I&#8217;ve hardcoded it.
See the guide I wrote (<a href="#step-by-step-guide">Step-by-step Instructions for Spinning up a Server</a>)
if you need tips on creating a sudo user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ansible uses SSH under the hood to talk to the server,
so checking we can log in "manually" is a good first step:</p>

<div class="title">Use WSL on Windows</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ansible will not run natively on Windows (see the
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/intro_windows.html#using-windows-as-the-control-node">docs</a>)
but you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL),
a sort of mini-Linux that Microsoft has made to run inside Windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll find some instructions for setting up WSL at
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment" class="bare">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once inside your WSL environment, you can navigate to your project directory
on the host Windows filesystem at, eg, <em>/mnt/c/Users/yourusername/Projects/superlists</em>,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need to use a different virtualenv for WSL:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock skipme">
<div class="content">
<pre>yourusername@wsl: <strong>cd /mnt/c/Users/yourusername/Projects/superlists</strong>
yourusername@wsl: <strong>python -m venv .venv-wsl</strong>
yourusername@wsl: <strong>source .venv-wsl/bin/activate</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using public key authentication,
it&#8217;s probably simplest to to generate a new SSH keypair,
and add it to <em>home/elspeth/.ssh/authorized_keys</em> on the server</p>

<div class="listingblock skipme">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d suggest you <em>only</em> use WSL when you need to use Ansible.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming we can reliably SSH into the server,
it&#8217;s time to install Ansible and make sure it can talk to our server as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take a look at the
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible installation guide</a>
for all the various options,
but probably the simplest thing to do is to install Ansible into the virtualenv
on our local machine (Ansible doesn&#8217;t need to be installed on the server):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock skipme">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>pip install ansible</strong>

$ <strong>pip install docker</strong></pre>

<h4 id="_checking_ansible_can_talk_to_our_server">Checking Ansible can Talk To Our Server</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the last step in making sure we&#8217;re ready,
making sure Ansible can talk to our server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the core of ansible is what&#8217;s called a "playbook",
which describes what we want to happen on our server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s create one now.
It&#8217;s probably a good idea to keep it in a folder of its own:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><strong>mkdir infra</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And here&#8217;s a minimal playbook whose job is just to "ping"
the server, to check we can talk to it.
It&#8217;s in a format called YAML (Yet Another Markup Language),
which, if you&#8217;ve never come across before,
you will soon develop a love-hate relationship<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>

In the next chapter, we&#8217;ll use Ansible to get our app up and running
on our server.  It&#8217;ll be a thrill I promise!</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">VPS vs PaaS</dt>
<dd>
<p>We discussed the tradeoffs of running your own server vs opting for a PaaS.
A VPS is great for learning, but you might find the lower admin overhead
of a PaaS makes sense for real projects.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Domain Name Registration and DNS</dt>
<dd>
<p>This tends to be something you only do once,
but buying a domain name and pointing it at your server
is an unavoidable part of hosting a web app.
Now you know your TTLs from your A-Records!</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">SSH</dt>
<dd>
<p>SSH is the swiss army knife of server admin.
The dream is that everything is automated,
but now and again you just gotta open up a shell on that box!</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Ansible</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ansible will be our deployment automation tool.
We&#8217;ve had the barest of teasers,
but we have it installed and we&#8217;re ready to learn how to use it.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_1">
<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. Strictly speaking, A-records are for IPv4, and you can also use AAAA-records for IPv6. Some cheap providers only support IPv6, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_2">
<a href="#_footnoteref_2">2</a>. The "love" part is that YAML is very easy to <em>read</em> and scan through at a glance. The "hate" part is that the actual syntax is surprisingly fiddly to get right: the difference between lists and key/value maps is subtle and I can never quite remember it honestly.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_3">
<a href="#_footnoteref_3">3</a>. The "i" stands for "inventory". Using the -i flag is actually a little unconventional. If you read the Ansible docs, you&#8217;ll find they usually recommend having an "inventory file" which lists all your servers, along with various bits of qualifying metadata. That&#8217;s overkill for our usecase tho!
