<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here follow a few suggestions for things to investigate next, to develop your
testing skills, and to apply them to some of the cool new technologies in web
development (at the time of writing!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope to turn each one of these into at least some sort of blog post,
if not a future appendix to the book. I hope to also produce code examples for
all of them, as time goes by. So do check out
<a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com" class="bare">http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com</a>, and see if there
are any updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or, why not try and beat me to it, and write your own blog post chronicling
your attempt at any one of these?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m very happy to answer questions and provide tips and guidance on all
these topics, so if you find yourself attempting one and getting stuck,
please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch at <a href="mailto:obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com">obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com</a>!</p>

<h3 id="_notifications_both_on_the_site_and_by_email">Notifications&#8212;&#8203;Both on the Site and by Email</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

It would be nice if users were notified when someone shares a list with
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use django-notifications to show a message to users the next
time they refresh the screen. You&#8217;ll need two browsers in your FT for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And/or, you could send notifications by email.  Investigate Django&#8217;s
email test capabilities.  Then, decide this is so critical that you need
real tests with real emails.  Use the IMAPClient library to fetch actual
emails from a test webmail account.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_switch_to_postgres">Switch to Postgres</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

SQLite is a wonderful little database, but it won&#8217;t deal well once you
have more than one web worker process fielding your site&#8217;s requests.
Postgres is everyone&#8217;s favourite database these days, so find out how
to install and configure it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need to figure out a place to store the usernames and passwords for your
local, staging, and production Postgres servers.  Since, for security, you
probably don&#8217;t want them in your code repository, look into ways of modifying
your deploy scripts to pass them in at the command line.  Environment variables
are one popular solution for where to keep them&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Experiment with keeping your unit tests running with SQLite, and compare how
much faster they are than running against Postgres.  Set it up so that your
local machine uses SQLite for testing, but your CI server uses Postgres.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_run_your_tests_against_different_browsers">Run Your Tests Against Different Browsers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Selenium supports all sorts of different browsers, including Chrome and
Internet Exploder.  Try them both out and see if your FT suite behaves
any differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
You should also check out a "headless" browser like PhantomJS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my experience, switching browsers tends to expose all sorts of race
conditions in Selenium tests, and you will probably need to use the
interaction/wait pattern a lot more (particularly for PhantomJS).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_404_and_500_tests">404 and 500 Tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
A professional site needs good looking error pages.  Testing a 404 page is
easy, but you&#8217;ll probably need a custom "raise an exception on purpose" view
to test the 500 page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_django_admin_site">The Django Admin Site</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Imagine a story where a user emails you wanting to "claim" an anonymous
list.  Let&#8217;s say we implement a manual solution to this, involving the site
administrator manually changing the record using the Django admin site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Find out how to switch on the admin site, and have a play with it. Write an FT
that shows a normal, non-logged-in user creating a list, then have an admin
user log in, go to the admin site, and assign the list to the user.  The user
can then see it in their "My Lists" page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_write_some_security_tests">Write Some Security Tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Expand on the login, my lists, and sharing tests&#8212;&#8203;what do you need to write to
assure yourself that users can only do what they&#8217;re authorized to?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_test_for_graceful_degradation">Test for Graceful Degradation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

What would happen if Persona went down?  Can we at least show an apologetic
error message to our users?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tip: one way of simulating Persona being down is to hack your hosts file (at <em>/etc/hosts</em> or <em>c:\Windows\Sytem32\drivers\etc</em>). Remember to revert it in
the test <code>tearDown</code>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the server side as well as the client side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_caching_and_performance_testing">Caching and Performance Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Find out how to install and configure <code>memcached</code>.  Find out how to use
Apache&#8217;s <code>ab</code> to run a performance test.  How does it perform with and without
caching? Can you write an automated test that will fail if caching is not
enabled? What about the dreaded problem of cache invalidation?  Can tests
help you to make sure your cache invalidation logic is solid?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_javascript_mvc_frameworks">JavaScript MVC Frameworks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>


JavaScript libraries that let you implement a Model-View-Controller
pattern on the client side are all the rage these days.  To-do lists are
one of the favourite demo applications for them, so it should be pretty easy
to convert the site to being a single-page site, where all list additions
happen in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick a framework&#8212;&#8203;perhaps Backbone.js or Angular.js&#8212;&#8203;and spike in an
implementation.  Each framework has its own preferences for how to write
unit tests, so learn the one that goes along with it, and see how you like
it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_async_and_websockets">Async and Websockets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Supposing two users are working on the same list at the same time. Wouldn&#8217;t
it be nice to see real-time updates, so if the other person adds an item to
the list, you see it immediately?  A persistent connection between client and
server using websockets is the way to get this to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Check out one of the Python async web servers&#8212;&#8203;Tornado, gevent, Twisted&#8212;&#8203;and
see if you can use it to implement dynamic notifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To test it, you&#8217;ll need two browser instances (like we used for the list
sharing tests), and check that notifications of the actions from one
appear in the other, without needing to refresh the page&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_switch_to_using_py_test">Switch to Using py.test</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<em>py.test</em> lets you write unit tests with less boilerplate.  Try converting some
of your unit tests to using <em>py.test</em>.  You may need to use a plugin to get it
to play nicely with Django.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_check_out_coverage_py">Check out coverage.py</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Ned Batchelder&#8217;s <code>coverage.py</code> will tell you what your <em>test coverage</em> is&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;what percentage of your code is covered by tests.  Now, in theory, because
we&#8217;ve been using rigorous TDD, we should always have 100% coverage.  But it&#8217;s
nice to know for sure, and it&#8217;s also a very useful tool for working on projects
that didn&#8217;t have tests from the beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_client_side_encryption">Client-Side Encryption</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Here&#8217;s a fun one: what if our users are paranoid about the NSA, and decide they
no longer want to trust their lists to The Cloud?  Can you build a JavaScript
encryption system, where the user can enter a password to encypher their list
item text before it gets sent to the server?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way of testing it might be to have an "administrator" user that goes to
the Django admin view to inspect users' lists, and checks that they are stored
encrypted in the database.</p>
