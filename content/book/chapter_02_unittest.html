Let&#8217;s adapt our test, which currently checks for the default Django "it worked" page,
and check instead for some of the things we want to see on the real front page of our site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time to reveal what kind of web app we&#8217;re building: a to-do lists site!
I know, I know, every other web dev tutorial online is also a to-do lists app,
or maybe a blog or a polls app.
I&#8217;m very much following fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason is that a to-do list is a really nice example.
At its most basic it is very simple indeed&#8212;&#8203;just a list of text strings&#8212;&#8203;so
it&#8217;s easy to get a "minimum viable" list app up and running.
But it can be extended in all sorts of ways&#8212;&#8203;different persistence models,
adding deadlines, reminders, sharing with other users, and improving the client-side UI.
There&#8217;s no reason to be limited to just &#8220;to-do&#8221; lists either;
they could be any kind of lists.
But the point is that it should allow me to demonstrate
all of the main aspects of web programming,
and how you apply TDD to them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tests that use Selenium let us drive a real web browser,
so they really let us see how the application <em>functions</em> from the user&#8217;s point of view.
That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called <em>functional tests</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This means that an FT can be a sort of specification for your application.
It tends to track what you might call a <em>User Story</em>,
and follows how the user might work with a particular feature
and how the app should respond to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Terminology: <br>Functional Test == Acceptance Test == End-to-End Test</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>


What I call functional tests, some people prefer to call <em>acceptance tests</em>,
or <em>end-to-end tests</em>.
The main point is that
these kinds of tests look at how the whole application functions,
from the outside.
Another names are <em>black box test</em> or <em>closed box test</em>
because the test doesn&#8217;t know anything about the internals of the system under test.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FTs should have a human-readable story that we can follow.
We make it explicit using comments that accompany the test code.
When creating a new FT, we can write the comments first,
to capture the key points of the User Story.
Being human-readable, you could even share them with nonprogrammers,
as a way of discussing the requirements and features of your app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TDD and agile or lean software development methodologies often go together,
and one of the things we often talk about is the minimum viable app;
what is the simplest thing we can build that is still useful?
Let&#8217;s start by building that, so that we can test the water as quickly as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A minimum viable to-do list really only needs to let the user enter some to-do items,
and remember them for their next visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open up <em>functional_tests.py</em> and write a story a bit like this one:</p>

<div class="title">We Have a Word for Comments&#8230;&#8203;</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first started at PythonAnywhere,
I used to virtuously pepper my code with nice descriptive comments.
My colleagues said to me:
&#8220;Harry, we have a word for comments. We call them lies.&#8221;
I was shocked!
I learned in school that comments are good practice?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They were exaggerating for effect.
There is definitely a place for comments that add context and intention.
But my colleagues were pointing out that comments aren&#8217;t always as useful as you hope.
For starters, it&#8217;s pointless to write a comment that just repeats what you&#8217;re doing with the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock skipme">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span class="tok-c1"># increment wibble by 1</span>
<span class="tok-n">wibble</span> <span class="tok-o">+=</span> <span class="tok-mi">1</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only is it pointless,
but there&#8217;s a danger that you&#8217;ll forget to update the comments when you update the code,
and they end up being misleading&#8212;&#8203;lies!
The ideal is to strive to make your code so readable,
to use such good variable names and function names,
and to structure it so well
that you no longer need any comments to explain <em>what</em> the code is doing.
Just a few here and there to explain <em>why</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other places where comments are very useful.
We&#8217;ll see that Django uses them a lot in the files it generates for us
to use as a way of suggesting helpful bits of its API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, of course, we use comments to explain the User Story in our functional tests&#8212;&#8203;by
forcing us to make a coherent story out of the test,
it makes sure we&#8217;re always testing from the point of view of the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is more fun to be had in this area,
things like <em>Behaviour-Driven Development</em> (see <a href="/book/appendix_bdd.html">[appendix_bdd]</a>)
and building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for testing,
but they&#8217;re topics for other booksfootnote:
Check out this video by the great Dave Farley if you want a taste:
<a href="https://youtu.be/JDD5EEJgpHU?t=272" class="bare">https://youtu.be/JDD5EEJgpHU?t=272</a>
].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more on comments, I recommend John Ousterhoudt&#8217;s <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>,
which you can get a taste of by reading
his <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs190-spring16/lecture.php?topic=comments">lecture notes from the chapter on comments.</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that, apart from writing the test out as comments,
I&#8217;ve updated the <code>assert</code> to look for the word &#8220;To-Do&#8221; instead of Django&#8217;s &#8220;Congratulations&#8221;.
That means we expect the test to fail now.  Let&#8217;s try running it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, start up the server:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then, in another terminal, run the tests:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock pause-first">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>python functional_tests.py</strong>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...goat-book/functional_tests.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    assert "To-Do" in browser.title
AssertionError</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
That&#8217;s what we call an <em>expected fail</em>,
which is actually good news&#8212;&#8203;not quite as good as a test that passes,
but at least it&#8217;s failing for the right reason;
we can have some confidence we&#8217;ve written the test correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_python_standard_librarys_unittest_module">The Python Standard Library&#8217;s unittest Module</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of little annoyances we should probably deal with.
Firstly, the message "AssertionError" isn&#8217;t very helpful&#8212;&#8203;it would be nice
if the test told us what it actually found as the browser title.  Also, it&#8217;s
left a Firefox window hanging around the desktop, so it would be nice if that
got cleared up for us automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One option would be to use the second parameter of the <code>assert</code> keyword,
something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock skipme">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span class="tok-k">assert</span> <span class="tok-s2">"To-Do"</span> <span class="tok-ow">in</span> <span class="tok-n">browser</span><span class="tok-o">.</span><span class="tok-n">title</span><span class="tok-p">,</span> <span class="tok-sa">f</span><span class="tok-s2">"Browser title was </span><span class="tok-si">{</span><span class="tok-n">browser</span><span class="tok-o">.</span><span class="tok-n">title</span><span class="tok-si">}</span><span class="tok-s2">"</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And we could also use a <code>try/finally</code> to clean up the old Firefox window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But these sorts of problems are quite common in testing,
and there are some ready-made <span class="keep-together">solutions</span> for us

<p>The <code>-a</code> means &#8220;automatically add any changes to tracked files&#8221;
(i.e., any files that we&#8217;ve committed before).
It won&#8217;t add any brand new files
(you have to explicitly <code>git add</code> them yourself),
but often, as in this case, there aren&#8217;t any new files,
so it&#8217;s a useful shortcut.</p>

<p>Now that our FT uses a real test framework,
and that we&#8217;ve got placeholder comments for what we want it to do,
we&#8217;re in an excellent position to start writing some real code for our lists app.
