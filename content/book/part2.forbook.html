<p>It&#8217;s time to deploy the first version of our site and make it public.
They say that if you wait until you feel <em>ready</em> to ship,
then you&#8217;ve waited too long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is our site usable? Is it better than nothing? Can we make lists on it?
Yes, yes, yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No, you can&#8217;t log in yet.
No, you can&#8217;t mark tasks as completed.
But do we really need any of that stuff?
Not really&#8212;&#8203;and you can never be sure
what your users are <em>actually</em> going to do with your site
once they get their hands on it.
We think our users want to use the site for to-do lists,
but maybe they actually want to use it
to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists,
for which you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> any kind of "mark completed" function.
We won&#8217;t know until we put it out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the next couple of chapters we&#8217;re going to go through
and actually deploy our site to a real, live web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be tempted to skip this bit&#8212;&#8203;there&#8217;s lots of daunting stuff in it,
and maybe you think this isn&#8217;t what you signed up for.
But I <em>strongly</em> urge you to give it a go.
This is one of the sections of the book I&#8217;m most pleased with,
and it&#8217;s one that people often write to me about
saying they were really glad they stuck through it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve never done a server deployment before,
it will demystify a whole world for you,
and there&#8217;s nothing like the feeling of seeing your site live
on the actual internet.
Give it a buzzword name like "DevOps"
if that&#8217;s what it takes to convince you it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<h3 id="_the_danger_areas_of_deployment">The Danger Areas of Deployment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deploying a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.
Oft heard is the forlorn cry, "but it works on my machine!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Some of the danger areas of deployment include:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Networking</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once we&#8217;re off our own machine, networking issues come in:
making sure that DNS is routing our domain to the correct IP address for our server,
making sure our server is configured to listen to traffic coming in from the world,
making sure it&#8217;s using the right ports,
and making sure any firewalls in the way are configured to let traffic through.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>We need to make sure that the packages our software relies on
(Python, Django, and so on) are installed on the server
and have the correct versions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">The database</dt>
<dd>
<p>There can be permissions and path issues,
and we need to be careful about preserving data between deploys.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Web servers usually need special configuration for serving these.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Security and configuration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once we&#8217;re on the public internet,
we need to worry more about security.
Various settings that are really useful for local development
(like the Django debug page)
become dangerous in production
(because they expose our source code in tracebacks).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reproducibility and divergence between local dev and prod</dt>
<dd>
<p>All of the above add up to differences between your local development environment
and the way code runs in production.
We want to be able to reproduce the way things work on our machine,
as closely as possible, in production (and vice versa)
to give us as much confidence as possible that
"it works on my machine" means "it&#8217;s going to work in production".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to approach the problem is to get a server
and start manually configuring and installing everything,
hacking about until it works,
and maybe think about automating things later.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if there&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve learned
in the world of Agile/Lean software development,
it&#8217;s that taking smaller steps usually pays off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can we take smaller, safer steps towards a production deployment?
Can we <em>simulate</em> the process of moving to a server
so that we can iron out all the bugs
before we actually take the plunge?
Can we then make small changes one at a time,
solving problems one by one,
rather than having to bite off everything in one mouthful?
Can we use our existing test suite to make sure things
work on the server, as well as locally?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Absolutely we can.  And if you&#8217;ve looked at the table of contents,
I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re already guessing that Docker is going
to be part of the answer.</p>

<h3 id="_an_overview_of_our_deployment_procedure">An Overview of Our Deployment Procedure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the next three chapters, I&#8217;m going to go through a deployment procedure.
It isn&#8217;t meant to be the <em>perfect</em> deployment procedure,
so please don&#8217;t take it as being best practice
or a recommendation&#8212;&#8203;it&#8217;s meant to be an illustration,
to show the kinds of issues involved in putting code into production,
and where testing fits in.</p>

<h3 id="_tdd_and_docker_versus_the_danger_areas_of_deployment">TDD and Docker Versus the Danger Areas of Deployment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully you can start to see how the combination of TDD, Docker, staging,
and automation are going to help minimise the risk of the various "danger areas":</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Containers as mini servers</dt>
<dd>
<p>Containers will act as mini servers
letting us flush out issues with dependencies, static files, and so on.
A key advantage is that they&#8217;ll give us a way of getting faster feedback cycles;
because we can spin them up locally almost instaneously,
we can very quicly see the effect of any changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Packaging Python and system dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our containers will package up both our Python and system dependencies,
including a production-ready web server and static files system,
as well as many production settings and configuration differences.
This minimises the difference between what we can test locally,
and what we will have on our servers.
As we&#8217;ll see, it will give us a reliable way to reproduce bugs we see in production,
on our local machine.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fully automated FTs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our FTs mean that we&#8217;ll have a fully automated way of checking
that everything works.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Running FTs on staging server</dt>
<dd>
<p>Later, when we deploy our containers to a staging server,
we can run the FTs against that too.
It&#8217;ll be slightly slower and might involve some fiddly compromises,
but it&#8217;ll give us one more layer of reassurance.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Automating build and deployment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Finally, by fully automating container creation and deployment,
and by testing the end results of both these things,
we maximise reproducibility, thus minimising the risk of deployment to production.</p>
