<h2 id="_acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lots of people to thank, without whom this book would never have happened,
and/or would have been even worse than it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks first to "Greg" at $OTHER_PUBLISHER, who was the first person to
encourage me to believe it really could be done. Even though your employers
turned out to have overly regressive views on copyright, I&#8217;m forever grateful
that you believed in me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to Michael Foord, another ex-employee of Resolver Systems, for providing
the original inspiration by writing a book himself, and thanks for his ongoing
support for the project.  Thanks also to my boss Giles Thomas, for foolishly
allowing another one of his employees to write a book (although I believe he&#8217;s
now changed the standard employment contract to say "no books").  Thanks also
for your ongoing wisdom and for setting me off on the testing path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to my other colleagues, Glenn Jones and Hansel Dunlop, for being
invaluable sounding boards, and for your patience with my one-track record
conversation over the last year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to my wife Clementine, and to both my families, without whose support
and patience I would never have made it.  I apologise for all the time spent
with nose in computer on what should have been memorable family occasions. I
had no idea when I set out what the book would do to my life ("Write it in my
spare time, you say?  That sounds reasonable&#8230;&#8203;").  I couldn&#8217;t have done it
without you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to my tech reviewers, Jonathan Hartley, Nicholas Tollervey, and Emily
Bache, for your encouragements and invaluable feedback.   Especially Emily,
who actually conscientiously read every single chapter.  Partial credit
to Nick and Jon, but that should still be read as eternal gratitude. Having
y&#8217;all around made the whole thing less of a lonely endeavour. Without all of
you the book would have been little more than the nonsensical ramblings of an
idiot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to everyone else who&#8217;s given up some of their time to give some
feedback on the book, out of nothing more than the goodness of their heart:
Gary Bernhardt, Mark Lavin, Matt O&#8217;Donnell, Michael Foord, Hynek Schlawack,
Russell Keith-Magee, Andrew Godwin, Kenneth Reitz, and Nathan Stocks.  Thanks
for being much smarter than I am, and for preventing me from saying several
stupid things.  Naturally, there are still plenty of stupid things left in the
book, for which y&#8217;all can absolutely not be held responsible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to my editor Meghan Blanchette, for being a very friendly and likeable
slave driver, and for keeping the book on track, both in terms of timescales
and by restraining my sillier ideas.  Thanks to all the others at
O&#8217;Reilly for your help, including Sarah Schneider, Kara Ebrahim, and
Dan Fauxsmith for letting me keep British English. Thanks to Charles
Roumeliotis for your help with style and grammar.  We may never see eye-to-eye
on the merits of Chicago School quotation/punctuation rules, but I sure am
glad you were around.  And thanks to the design department for giving us a goat
for the cover!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And thanks most especially to all my Early Release readers, for all your help
picking out typos, for your feedback and suggestions, for all the ways in
which you helped to smooth out the learning curve in the book, and most of
all for your kind words of encouragement and support that kept me going.

aggrieved; I am incredibly grateful to you too, so write to me and I will try
and make it up to you in any way I can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally thanks to you, the latest reader, for deciding to check out
the book!  I hope you enjoy it.</p>
