<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_python_3_6_and_programming">Python 3.6 and Programming</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve
tried to write this book with beginners in mind, but if you&#8217;re new to
programming, I&#8217;m assuming that you&#8217;ve already learned the basics of Python. So
if you haven&#8217;t already, do run through a Python beginner&#8217;s tutorial or get an
introductory book like <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/"><em>Dive Into Python</em></a>  or
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"><em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em></a>, or, just for
fun, <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/"><em>Invent Your Own Computer Games with
Python</em></a>, all of which are excellent introductions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re an experienced programmer but new to Python, you should get along
just fine.  Python is joyously simple to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m using <em>Python 3</em> for this book. When I wrote the first edition in 2013&#8211;14, Python 3
had been around for several years, and the world was just about on the tipping
point at which it was the preferred choice.  You should be able to follow this
book on Mac, Windows, or Linux.  Detailed installation instructions for each OS
follow.</p>

This book was tested against Python 3.6. If you&#8217;re on an earlier version,
    you will find minor differences (the f-string syntax, for example), so
    you&#8217;re best off upgrading if you can.  However, for the time being you can&#8217;t
    use Python3.7 because the version of Django we&#8217;re using is not compatible.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I
wouldn&#8217;t recommend trying to use Python 2, as the differences are more
substantial. You&#8217;ll still be able to carry across all the lessons you learn
in this book if your next project happens to be in Python 2.  But spending
time figuring out whether the reason your program output looks different from
mine is because of Python 2, or because you made an actual mistake, won&#8217;t be
time spent productively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If
you are thinking of using <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a> (the
PaaS startup I work for), rather than a locally installed Python, you should go
and take a quick look at <a href="/book/appendix_I_PythonAnywhere.html">[appendix1]</a> before you get started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, I expect you to have access to Python, to know how to launch it
from a command line, and to know how to edit a Python file and run it.  Again,
have a look at the three books I recommended previously if you&#8217;re in any doubt.</p>

If you already have Python 2 installed, and you&#8217;re worried that
    installing Python 3 will break it in some way, don&#8217;t!  Python 3 and 2 can
    coexist peacefully on the same system, particularly if you&#8217;re using
    a virtualenv, which we will be.

<h3 id="_how_html_works">How HTML Works</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m
also assuming you have a basic grasp of how the web works&#8212;&#8203;what HTML is,
what a POST request is, and so on.  If you&#8217;re not sure about those, you&#8217;ll need to
find a basic HTML tutorial; there are a few at <a href="http://www.webplatform.org/" class="bare">http://www.webplatform.org/</a>.  If
you can figure out how to create an HTML page on your PC and look at it in your
browser, and understand what a form is and how it might work, then you&#8217;re
probably OK.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_django">Django</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The
book uses the Django framework, which is (probably) the most
well-established web framework in the Python world.  I&#8217;ve written the book
assuming that the reader has no prior knowledge of Django, but if you&#8217;re
new to Python <em>and</em> new to web development <em>and</em> new to testing,  you may
occasionally find that there&#8217;s just one too many topics and sets of concepts
to try and take on board.  If that&#8217;s the case, I recommend taking a break from
the book, and taking a look at a Django tutorial.
<a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">DjangoGirls</a> is the best, most
beginner-friendly tutorial I know of.  The
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/">official tutorial</a>
is also excellent for more experienced programmers (make sure you follow the
1.11 tutorial rather than a 2.x one though).</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Don&#8217;t use Django 2</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book was published before Django 2.0 came out, and as such is
written for Django v1.11 (which is a "long-term-support" or LTS edition).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking.  You&#8217;re thinking, come on, what&#8217;s the
point in learning an old version, I may as well learn the latest one,
I&#8217;ll follow along with Django 2 and just figure it out for myself when
things are different.  How hard can it be?  I know you&#8217;re thinking this
because it&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;d be thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s never <em>that</em> hard.  But look, this is not a short book,
there&#8217;s a lot of code to follow along with, and at several points I
<em>guarantee</em> you are going to be staring at something on your screen that
looks nothing like what I say it should in the book.  At those points,
it&#8217;s hard enough debugging all the moving parts for any mistakes you
might have made, without having to add in the extra possibility that
it&#8217;s something to do with Django 2 vs Django 1.11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So my strong recommendation is, stick with 1.11.  The new version is
not that different, and if you need to learn Django 2 for your next project,
it&#8217;ll take you all of 2 hours to go through the official tutorial. Plus if you
get stuck and you&#8217;re on Django 2, I won&#8217;t be able to help you.</p>

<p>Read on for installation instructions.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a little bit of JavaScript in the second half of the book.  If you
don&#8217;t know JavaScript, don&#8217;t worry about it until then, and if you find
yourself a little confused, I&#8217;ll recommend a couple of guides at that point.</p>

<div class="title">A Note on IDEs</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If
you&#8217;ve come from the world of Java or .NET, you may be keen to use an IDE
for your Python coding.  They have all sorts of useful tools, including VCS
integration, and there are some excellent ones out there for Python.  I used
one myself when I was starting out, and I found it very useful for my first
couple of projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can I suggest (and it&#8217;s only a suggestion) that you <em>don&#8217;t</em> use an IDE, at
least for the duration of this tutorial? IDEs are much less necessary in the
Python world, and I&#8217;ve written this whole book with the assumption that you&#8217;re
just using a basic text editor and a command line.  Sometimes, that&#8217;s all you
have&#8212;&#8203;when you&#8217;re working on a server, for example&#8212;&#8203;so it&#8217;s always worth
learning how to use the basic tools first and understanding how they work.
It&#8217;ll be something you always have, even if you decide to go back to your IDE
and all its helpful tools, after you&#8217;ve finished this book.</p>

users can sometimes feel a little neglected in the open source world,

letters?  What?   Still, it is absolutely possible to follow along with this
book on Windows.  Here are a few tips:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When you install Git for Windows, make sure you choose <strong>"Run Git and

access to a program called "Git Bash". Use this as your main command prompt
and you&#8217;ll get all the useful GNU command-line tools like <code>ls</code>, <code>touch</code>,
and <code>grep</code>, plus forward-slash directory separators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also in the Git installer, choose <strong>"Use Windows' default console"</strong>;
otherwise, Python won&#8217;t work properly in the Git-Bash window.</p>

<p>When you install Python 3, unless you already have Python 2 and want to keep
it as your default, tick the option that says <strong>"Add Python 3.6 to PATH"</strong> as
in <a href="#add-python-to-path">Add Python to the system path from the installer</a>, so that you can easily run Python from the

    Although the normal Python installer is now fine, you may find Homebrew

<p>I&#8217;ll

get a bit of configuration done now.  For example, when you do your first

to do with it. Well, much as vi has two modes, you then have two choices. One
is to learn some minimal vi commands <em>(press the i key to go into insert mode,
type your text, press <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to go back to normal mode, then write the file
and quit with <code>:wq&lt;Enter&gt;</code>)</em>. You&#8217;ll then have joined the great fraternity of

you&#8217;re new to virtualenvs&#8212;&#8203;or even if you&#8217;re not, to be honest&#8212;&#8203;at some
point you&#8217;re <em>guaranteed</em> to forget to activate it, and then you&#8217;ll be
staring at an error message.  Happens to me all the time.  Here are some of the
things to look out for:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>ImportError: No module named selenium</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>ImportError: No module named django.core.management</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, look out for that <code>(virtualenv)</code> in your command prompt, and a
quick <code>source virtualenv/Scripts/activate</code> or <code>source
virtualenv/bin/activate</code> is probably what you need to get it working again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a couple more, for good measure:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate: No such file or directory</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means you&#8217;re not currently in the right directory for working on the
project.  Try a <code>cd tdd-python-book</code>, or similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re in the right place, you may have run into
a bug from an older version of Python, where it wouldn&#8217;t install
an activate script that was compatible with Git-Bash.  Reinstall Python 3, and
make sure you have version 3.6.3 or later, and then delete and re-create your
virtualenv.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see something like this, it&#8217;s probably the same issue, you need to
upgrade Python:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>bash: @echo: command not found
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4:
      syntax error near unexpected token `(
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4: `if not defined PROMPT ('</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Final one!  If you see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve launched the default Windows command prompt, <code>cmd</code>,
instead of Git-Bash.  Close it and open the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">On Anaconda</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anaconda is another tool for managing different Python environments.  It&#8217;s
particularly popular on Windows and for scientific computing, where it can
be hard to get some of the compiled libraries to install.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the world of web programming it&#8217;s much less necessary, so <em>I recommend you do not use Anaconda for this book</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from anything else I don&#8217;t know enough about it to help you debug any
problems with it if they occur!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend installing Firefox via Homebrew     though: <code>brew</code> puts the Firefox binary in a strange location, and it     confuses Selenium. You can work around it, but it&#8217;s simpler to just install     Firefox in the normal way.
