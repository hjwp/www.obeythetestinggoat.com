<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is there any point in learning TDD now that AI can write code for you?
A single prompt could probably generate the entire example application in this book,
including all its tests, and the infrastructure config for automated deployment too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s too early to tell.  AI is still in its infancy,
and who knows what it&#8217;ll be able to do in a few years or even months' time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ai_is_both_insanely_impressive_and_incredibly_unreliable">AI is Both Insanely Impressive and Incredibly Unreliable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we do know is that right now,
AI is both insanely impressive and incredibly unreliable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond being able to understand and respond to prompts in normal human language--
it&#8217;s easy to forget how absolutely extraordinary that is; literally science-fiction
a few years ago&#8212;&#8203;AI tools can generate working code, they can generate tests,
they can help us to break down requirements, brainstorm solutions,
quickly prototype new technologies.  It&#8217;s genuinely astonishing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;re all finding out though, this all comes with a massive "but".
AI outputs are frequently plagued by hallucinations,
and in the world of code, that means things that just won&#8217;t work,
even if they look plausible.
Worse than that, they can produce code that appears to work,
but is full of subtle bugs, security issues, or performance nightmares.
From a code quality point of view, we know that AI tools will often produce
code that&#8217;s filled with copy-paste and duplication, weird hacks,
and undecipherable spaghetti code that spells a maintenance nightmare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mitigations_for_ais_shortcomings_sure_look_a_lot_like_tdd">Mitigations for AI&#8217;s Shortcomings Sure Look A Lot Like TDD</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you read the advice, even from AI companies themselves,
about the best way to work with AI, you&#8217;ll find that it
performs best when working in small, well-defined contexts,
with frequent checks for correctness.
When taking on larger tasks, the advice is to break them down into smaller,
well-defined pieces, with clearly defined success criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we&#8217;re thinking about the problem of hallucinations,
it sure seems like having a comprehensive test suite and running it frequently,
is going to be a must-have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we&#8217;re thinking about code quality, the idea of having a human in the loop,
with frequent pauses for review and refactoring,
again seems like a key mitigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, all of the techniques of Test-Driven Development that are outlined in this book:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defining a test that describes each small change of functionality,
before we write the code for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking our problem down into small pieces and working incrementally,
with frequent test runs to catch bugs, regressions, and hallucinations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "refactor" step in TDD&#8217;s Red/Green/Refactor cycle,
which gives us a regular reminder for the human in the loop to review and improve the code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TDD is all about finding a structured, safer way of developing software,
reducing the risk of bugs and regressions and improving code quality,
and these are very much the exact same things that we need to achieve
when working with AI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_leaky_abstractions_and_the_importance_of_experience">Leaky Abstractions and the Importance of Experience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">"Leaky abstractions"</a>
are a diagnosis of a common problem in software development,
whereby higher-level abstractions fail in subtle ways,
and the complexities of the underlying system leak through.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the presence of leaky abstractions, you need to understand the lower-level system
to be able to work effectively.
It&#8217;s for this reason that, when the switch to third-generation languages (3GLs) happened,
programmers who understood the underlying machine code were often the most effective
at using the new languages like C and Fortran.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a similar way, AI offers us a new, higher-level abstraction around writing code,
but we can already see the "leaks" in the form of hallucinations and poor code quality.
And by analogy to the 3GLs, the programmers who are going to be most effective with AI
are going to be the ones who "know what good looks like",
both in terms of code quality, test structure and so on,
but also in terms of what a safe and reliable workflow for software development looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_my_own_experiences_with_ai">My Own Experiences with AI</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my own experiences of working with AI,
I&#8217;ve been very impressed at its ability to write tests, for example&#8230;&#8203;
as long as there was already a good first example test to copy from.
Its ability to write that <em>first</em> test,
the one where, as we&#8217;ll see, a lot of the design (and thinking) happens in TDD,
was much more mixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly when working in a less "autocomplete" and more "agentic" mode,
I saw AI tools do very well on simple problems with clear instructions,
but when trying to deal with more complex logic and requirements with ambiguity,
I&#8217;ve seen it get dreadfully stuck in loops and dead ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When that happened, I found that trying to guide the AI agent
back towards taking small steps, working on a single piece at a time,
and clarifying requirements in tests, was the best way to get things back on track.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve also been able to experiment with using the "refactor" step
to try and improve the often-terrible code that the AI produced.
Here again I had mixed results, where the AI would need a lot of nudging
before settling on a solution that felt sufficiently readable and maintainable, to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I&#8217;d echo what many others are saying, which is that AI works best
when you, the user, are a discerning partner rather than passive recipient.</p>

<h3 id="_the_ai_enabled_workflow_of_the_future">The AI-Enabled Workflow of the Future</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AI-enabled workflow of the future
will look very different to what we have now,
but all the indications are that the most effective approach is going to be
incremental, have checks and balances to avoid hallucinations,
and systematically involve humans in the loop to ensure quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the closest workflow we have to that today, is TDD.
I&#8217;m excited to share it with you!</p>
