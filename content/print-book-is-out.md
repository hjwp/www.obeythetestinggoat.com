*(OK that actually happened last month.  This post is a little late.  I was distracted by Oscons and stuff!)*

Anyway, that's it, it's officially available. If you've been reading the free online version and have been holding out until the print version comes out, now's the time!

Or, if you've been waiting for the print version to come out before recommending the book to a friend, or buying a book for your local usergroup, or whatever it'll be, you know...

* [Buy the book via O'Reilly](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7347114-11724864).
* [Buy the book on amazon.com](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449364829/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1449364829&linkCode=as2&tag=obethetesgoa-21)

The online version will always be free and licensed under creative commons.  I'll just link to the acknowledgements chapter, since it really wouldn't have been possible without all the help I got:

It's been a crazy 18 months. Happy reading everyone!
