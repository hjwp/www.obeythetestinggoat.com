Summary: Following the success of the "beginners' day" at EuroPython 2015, I'm running a "Python Bootcamp" for beginners at Pycon US this year, and I need your help!


> Coming to Pycon? Want to help some beginners to get to grips with Python, and
> get the most out of the conference? I need your help!


Having observed the surprising number of beginners to be found at Python
conferences, I organised a "beginners' day" at last year's EuroPython in
Bilbao.  We had about 30 beginners attend (from a crowd of 1200 at the
conference) -- quite a few science types, some people who already knew another
language but wanted to learn Python, and a few total beginners. Everyone seemed
to leave with lots of nice things to say about it.

Here's a couple of clips:

* [The oath of the mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI-BFxeumv8)


I'm running something similar at Pycon this year, on the first day of the tutorials:

[Python Bootcamp at Pycon USA 2016, May 28th](https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2258/)


The basic idea is shamelessly stolen from the awesome
[DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/), and is mainly
structured around:

* **self-directed learning** based on a selection of Python **tutorials** (one
  for total beginners, one for sciencey types, one for web developers, one for
  programmers who already know another language, and so on)

* **coached** by friendly Python developers sitting near each attendee

* supplemented by **a few short lectures** on the Python "ecosystem" (what is
  the cheese shop / the bdfl / a pep / pip / requests / IPython notebook / etc
  etc)

There's more info in the
[repo](https://github.com/hjwp/python-conference-beginners-day).

I need more coaches!  I would love to get to a 3-to-1 ratio of attendees to
mentors.  You don't have to be an expert Python developer, you just have to be
a friendly person, that remembers how tough it can be as a beginner, and that
wants to help.  I expect quite a few "data science" people in particular, so
if you have skills in that area (even if you've only just learned them yourself),
I want you!

Check out the [DjangoGirls coach manual](http://coach.djangogirls.org/) for
a flavour of the kind of attitude I'm trying to cultivate.  And don't forget
you'll have to swear the "Oath of the Mentor", as per the link above.

Helping beginners is a great feeling, I hope you'll join me!  Emails to 
[obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com](mailto:obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com) please :)


*PS: This is not a free event for attendees, but I am donating my entire fee
for it back to the PSF.  Minus, perhaps, a small budget set aside for
"thankyou" drinks and cakes for coaches :)*
