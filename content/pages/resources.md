* My [TDD / Django Tutorial at PyCon 2013](http://pyvideo.org/video/1657/fully-test-driven-web-development-with-django-and) (video)

* The legendary Gary Bernhardt on unit test speed at Pycon 2013: [Fast Tests, Slow test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k), and a follow-up / complement called [Boundaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOYal8elnZk). I'm probably a bit lax about fast tests... (video)

* Emily Bache's [online course in Python unit testing](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/unit-testing-python) featuring the excellent py.test. (paywall)

* Another PyCon talk on [how to get started with automated testing](http://pyvideo.org/video/1674/getting-started-with-automated-testing) (video)

* [Flipping the bit](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/01/11/Flipping-the-Bit.html) "What if you were on the Starship Enterprise and the warp coil was seconds away from an anti-matter explosion and all you needed to do was invert one IF statement to save the ship. Would you use TDD for that?: Yes."  Thanks, uncle Bob.

* [TDD London Style with Ruby RSpec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdNnN5yTIeM) by Gary Bernhardt again. Ruby, sacrilege obviously, but RSpec is pretty cool, Gary's typing has to be seen to be believed, and if "London Style" is actually a think I guess I have to link to it! (video)

* Selenium are really pushing the boundaries -- you can now [use Selenium to test mobile apps](http://pyvideo.org/video/1699/mobile-application-testing-with-python-and-seleni) -- and not just the mobile browsers, native apps too.  (video)

* Carl Meyer's thoughts on [Testing and Django](http://pyvideo.org/video/699/testing-and-django), good on the pitfalls of using the database too much in "unit" tests (something I probably need to talk about in the book...). See also this discussion on [/r/Python](http://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1c67rl/is_tddjangotutorial_truly_a_good_resource_i_want/) (video)

* [How can I motivate coworkers to write unit tests?](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-can-i-motivate-coworkers-to-write-unit-tests/) (thanks Jason)

* Want to get really chin-strokey about testing?  Read [Mocks aren't stubs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html), and form some strong opinions about what the One True Way should be...
