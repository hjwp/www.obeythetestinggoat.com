"Test-Driven Web Development with Python" aims to teach TDD for web
programming. It uses a concrete example -- the development of a website,
from scratch -- to explain the TDD metholology and how it applies to 
building web applications. It covers the Selenium browser-automation tool,
unit testing, mocking, and interacting with Web technologies from the basics of
static content, database integration, throught the inescapable JavaScript, and
onto more advanced (and trendy) topics like NoSQL, websockets and Async
programming.


Reading it
----------

There are two ways you can read this book:

        Obviously this is my favourite option!  O'Reilly are great,
        they have DRM-free versions you can download in all sorts
        of formats (MOBI/epub/pdf), and you'll get updates
        automatically every few weeks.  You can also read it at

        Via O'Reilly' Chimera.  I see this as a "try-before-you-buy" scheme, and I hope
        that if you enjoy it you'll buy a copy -- if not for yourself, then perhaps for
        a friend!

Help!
-----

I feel incredibly lucky to be writing this book, and have the standard amounts of
impostor syndrome. I've only actually been doing TDD for a couple of years, and I've
only been a professional programmer for about 3 years.  But I feel I've learned a lot,
and I enjoy sharing the knowledge.

But the book would be much better if it reflected more than just my own limited 
perspective -- it would be nice if at least some of the huge amounts of experience
in the testing community were to filter into it, over and above my own limited 
experience.

So, If you're an experienced TDD-er, read my draft, and let me
know what you think: am I presenting TDD in the right way?  What would you do
differently?  Is there anything you think I'm missing?

If you're a beginner, I need your help too!  This book is meant to be fore you, so
let me know if the books works well for you as a lerning tool - am I going too 
fast or too slow, am I presenting things in an intelligible way, etc etc.

How to comment
--------------

The O'Reilly site allows you to submit "errata", and the Chimera site has a comments

philosophical discussion, you can get in touch with me directly via

</div>

You can even leave comments right here.  The important thing is, get in touch!
I look forward to hearing from you.
