"Test-Driven Web Development with Python" aims to teach TDD for web
programming. It uses a concrete example -- the development of a website,
from scratch -- to explain the TDD metholology and how it applies to 
building web applications. It covers the Selenium browser-automation tool,
unit testing, mocking, and interacting with Web technologies from the basics of
static content, database integration, throught the inescapable JavaScript, and
onto more advanced (and trendy) topics like NoSQL, websockets and Async
programming.

      Obviously these are my favourite options!  O'Reilly have been
      great, they deserve your support, and although I only get a
      small amount in royalties (about a dollar per sale if
      you're curious), it still pays for the occasional dinner
      out every month which I appreciate.  Plus, real physical
      books are nice...

Help yourself!
It's all free and CC-licenced (thanks O'Reilly!). 
I see this as a "try-before-you-buy" scheme, and I hope
that if you enjoy it you'll buy a copy -- if not for
yourself, then perhaps for a friend!

How to comment
--------------

I feel incredibly lucky to be writing this book, and have the standard amounts of
impostor syndrome. I've only actually been doing TDD for a couple of years, and I've
only been a professional programmer for about 3 years.  But I feel I've learned a lot,
and I enjoy sharing the knowledge.

The O'Reilly site allows you to submit "errata", and the Chimera site has a comments
function. Do use those for typos, errors etc.  If you'd like to have a more
philosophical discussion, you can get in touch with me directly via

<div class="small-3 small-centered columns">
    <p class="center-text">
        <a href="mailto:obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com">obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com</a>
    </p>
</div>

You can even leave comments right here.  The important thing is, get in touch!
I look forward to hearing from you.
