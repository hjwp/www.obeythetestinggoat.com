"Test-Driven Web Development with Python" aims to teach TDD for web
programming. It uses a concrete example -- the development of a website,
from scratch -- to explain the TDD metholology and how it applies to 
building web applications. It covers the Selenium browser-automation tool,
unit testing, mocking, and interacting with Web technologies from the basics of
static content, database integration, throught the inescapable JavaScript, and
onto more advanced (and trendy) topics like NoSQL, websockets and Async
programming.

      Obviously these are my favourite options!  O'Reilly have been
      great, they deserve your support, and although I only get a
      small amount in royalties (about a dollar per sale if
      you're curious), it still pays for the occasional dinner
      out every month which I appreciate.  Plus, real physical
      books are nice...

Help yourself!
It's all free and CC-licenced (thanks O'Reilly!). 
I see this as a "try-before-you-buy" scheme, and I hope
that if you enjoy it you'll buy a copy -- if not for
yourself, then perhaps for a friend!

# How to comment or get in touch

I am far from the ultimate authority on TDD,
and I'm always interested in talking about TDD, so do get in touch.

There's a comment system here for each individual chapter, so feel free to use that.


If you'd like to fix a typo, you can open a Pull Request at https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/pulls

If you'd like to have a more philosophical discussion,
or talk about anything Python or TDD-related,
you can get in touch with me directly via

<div class="small-3 small-centered columns">
    <p class="center-text">
        <a href="mailto:obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com">obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com</a>
    </p>
</div>

I look forward to hearing from you.
