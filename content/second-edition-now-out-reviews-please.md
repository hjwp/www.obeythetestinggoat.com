[Thanks](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/acknowledgments.html)
to everyone involved!

If you've been reading the free online edition and feel like showing your
support, then now's the time!  There's not a huge amount in it for me
financially (I get about a dollar off every sale) but it does add up,
and O'Reilly also deserve your support, they've been great.


### Reviews, please!

More importantly, I really need some reviews for the book, on Amazon and
elsewhere.  They make a real difference to sales, and they really help
other people to make the decision over whether they will find the book
useful.  So if you've enjoyed the book at all, do write a review for me
online.  That would be very, very much appreciated.



Thanks once again, dear readers, for your kind words and encouragement
throughout the process. I couldn't do it without you.
