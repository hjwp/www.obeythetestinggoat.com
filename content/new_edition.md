Summary: Since Persona is being retired later this year, I'm planning a new edition.  What changes and improvements would you like to see?

[Mozilla has announced](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/persona-notices/2016/000005.html)
that they are retiring the Persona project, which I use in the book from
chapter 15 onwards.  This is sad news, because it was a great project, but also
because it's going to break those chapters!  So O'Reilly have suggested I write
up a new edition of the book, and I'd like to get your suggestions and
feedback.

It's not meant to be a wholesale rewrite, mainly just find a replacement for
Persona, and then address a few improvements if I have time.   So my questions
to you are:

- What would you replace Persona with?
- What other changes or improvements would you like to see in the book?
- Are there any totally new topics you'd love to see covered? (and I'm not making any promises here!)

I've kicked off a discussion on the book's mailing list, and there's talk of JavaScript MVC frameworks, a REST API, docker, and much else.
