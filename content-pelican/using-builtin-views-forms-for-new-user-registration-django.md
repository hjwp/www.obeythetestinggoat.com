Summary: I think Django gives you everything you need for a new user registration form in about 2 lines of urls.py config... am i right?

Have been digging into the built-in forms and views from
django.contrib.auth.  I always knew you could get generic views for login,
logout, even password reset, but I didn't know you could actually handle
new user creation as well!

There's a form in `django.contrib.auth.forms`, and a class-based view for
creating new objects called `CreateView`, and I believe this is all you
need for a working registration form/view:

    :::python
    from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url('^register/', CreateView.as_view(
                template_name='register.html',
                form_class=UserCreationForm,
                success_url='/'
        )),
        url('^accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),

        # rest of your URLs as normal
    )

Then, in *register.html* (which you do have to create yourself), you get a 
`{{ form }}` you can use, including a username, password and password
confirmation, and it handles validation errors and EVERYTHING.

Obviously it doesn't include registering (and validating) an email address 
for the user, but still, I'm pretty excited.  Did everyone else already
know about this?
