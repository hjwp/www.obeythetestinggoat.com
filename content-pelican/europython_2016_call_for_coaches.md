> (the 17th) Want to help some beginners to get to grips with Python, and
> get the most out of the conference? I need your help!  

It's always surprising how many beginners come to Python conferences.  The
[beginners' day](https://ep2016.europython.eu/en/events/beginners-day/) is
a full-day event aimed at helping them to get the best out of the conference
-- getting them up to speed on the basics of Python, but also giving them
a bit of a tour around the Python ecosystem, Python in-jokes and jargon,
and what the conference is all about.

Here's an example of a happy beginner from last year:

The day is mainly structured around self-directed learning, where attendees
follow one of several selected tutorials, at their own speed.  Most imporantly
of all, they sit at tables with coaches -- more experienced Python programmers
ready to help them when they get stuck, explain things when they get confusing,
and help them find solutions to problems.

*(if you've ever attended a Djangogirls workshop, you'll see where I've
shamelessly stolen the idea from ;)*

I already have several coaches signed up, but it'd be great to have a few
more. You don't have to be a Python expert, just someone that remembers what it
was like to be a beginner, someone patient and kind and keen to help. Here's
[more on how to be a good coach](http://coach.djangogirls.org/tips/).

The workshop starts at 10AM on the Sunday before the conference, the 17th.

Helping beginners is a great feeling, I hope you'll join me!  Emails to
