Summary: Links to some awesome TDD stuff from EuroPython, and also my own talk + tutorial

I can't believe the videos are already up!  Here's a few links:

My usual [TDD/Django Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz-DIkpk7PM) now featuring the example from the book!
People's favourite bit seemed to be when I stand on the chair...

Me in a faster [TDD/Python talk in Italiano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0L3DuAPOVw).  Still can't believe the organisers
put me on as the first Italian talk of the whole week. I think it was some kind of evil joke.

Rob Collins' [Test-Driven-Madness ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj4nwh_VrPM) which I couldn't see 
because it was on at the same time as my tutorial, but from what he told me about it while we were
sitting at the same desk doing prep around 1AM the previous day, it was pretty entertaining. I have
had independent confirmation of this too.

[Holger Krekel on pytest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Z2JHUmZXM) again, haven't seen this, but 
any man that can speak that passionately about the politics of P2P cannot possibly ever go wrong.

Great conference so far! Any more out there?
