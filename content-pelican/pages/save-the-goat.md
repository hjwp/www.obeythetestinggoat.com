![NEW AWESOME GOAT COVER](/static/images/new_goat_cover_lrg.jpg)

WE DID IT!  

O'Reilly gave us a Goat!
------------------------

**And what a goat!  Look at it!  Glorious!**


*Thanks to each and every person that helped make it happen.  I hope you're 
as pleased as I am.  Thanks to Meghan my editor, thanks to the Design team
at O'Reilly, and, just, wow.  awesome.*


The old version of the post follows, for posterity...

My beloved publisher, O'Reilly, have suggested putting a snake on the cover 

-- "That's what we usually have, for Python books... Why, do you have a better
idea?"

-- "Yes, a goat"

-- "A goat? That's weird... Is it important to you?"


I'd say it is!  Let's help them to understand how dear the Testing Goat is to
the Python Testing community Share your pictures, emotional experiences,
favourite goat moments...  Every comment counts as a signature on this virtual
petition.

With your help we can have an **Actual O'Reilly Book** about TestingInPython
with **An Actual Goat** on the cover.  Wouldn't that be awesome?
