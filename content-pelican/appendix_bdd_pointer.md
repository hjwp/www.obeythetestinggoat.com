Summary: A whirlwind tour of BDD, and my first impressions

I've started working on a new appendix for the book, which is meant to be an
intro to BDD.  Will you head on over to the online version of the book and
tell me what you think?

[BDD appendix on Chimera](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/ape.html)


If you're an existing reader, do you think it makes a good addition to the
book?  If you're a BDD expert, is there anything I'm getting hideously wrong?
