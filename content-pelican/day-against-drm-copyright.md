When I was first speaking to publishers about this book, I was a bit nervous.
I'm very intersed in digital rights and copyright reform, and in fact I'm
a reasonably active member of Pirate Party UK (or I was until this little 
project sucked up all my spare time!)... Could I find a publishing deal that
would be compatible with my views?  One of my colleagues in the German Pirate
Party came in for a lot of criticism when she wrote a book and discovered her
publisher sending out DMCA notices to filesharing sites...

I support a manifesto that asks for a 10-year limit on copyright, and for all
non-commercial filesharing to be legal.  Could I find a publishing deal that
was at all consistent with that?  The first publisher I spoke to was having
none of it...

That's why I was so glad when O'Reilly said they had absolutely no problem
with me distributing the book under a CC license...  After a bit of haggling,
they even agree to a clause in the contract that would say that the book would
revert to a CC-0 Public Domain license after 10 years.  Even if you think
the policy of 10 years is too short for many domains, it's certainly enough
for commercial exploitation of a technical book.

So, hooray for my beloved publisher, hooray for Creative Commons, and hooray 
for the FSF!
