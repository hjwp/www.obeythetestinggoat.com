<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Back to the Testing Goat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Groan</em>, I hear you say, <em>Harry, the Testing Goat stopped being funny about
17 chapters ago</em>.  Bear with me, I&#8217;m going to use it to make a serious point.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_testing_is_hard">Testing Is Hard</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I
think the reason the phrase "Obey the Testing Goat" first grabbed me when I
saw it was that it really spoke to the fact that testing is hard&#8212;&#8203;not hard to
do in and of itself, but hard to <em>stick to</em>, and hard to keep doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It always feels easier to cut corners and skip a few tests.  And it&#8217;s doubly
hard psychologically because the payoff is so disconnected from the point at
which you put in the effort.  A test you spend time writing now doesn&#8217;t reward
you immediately, it only helps much later&#8212;&#8203;perhaps months later when it saves
you from introducing a bug while refactoring, or catches a regression when you
upgrade a dependency.  Or, perhaps it pays you back in a way that&#8217;s hard to
measure, by encouraging you to write better designed code, but you convince
yourself you could have written it just as elegantly without tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I myself started slipping when I was writing the
<a href="https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/tree/master/tests">test
framework for this book</a>.  Being a quite complex beast, it has tests of its
own, but I cut several corners, coverage isn&#8217;t perfect, and I now regret it
because it&#8217;s turned out quite unwieldy and ugly (go on, I&#8217;ve open sourced it
now, so you can all point and laugh).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_keep_your_ci_builds_green">Keep Your CI Builds Green</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another
area that takes real hard work is continuous integration.  You saw in
<a href="/book/chapter_25_CI.html">[chapter_25_CI]</a> that strange and unpredictable bugs sometimes occur on CI.
When you&#8217;re looking at these and thinking "it works fine on my machine",
there&#8217;s a strong temptation to just ignore them&#8230;&#8203;but, if you&#8217;re not careful,
you start to tolerate a failing test suite in CI, and pretty soon your CI build
is actually useless, and it feels like too much work to get it going again.
Don&#8217;t fall into that trap.  Persist, and you&#8217;ll find the reason that your test
is failing, and you&#8217;ll find a way to lock it down and make it deterministic,
and green, again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_take_pride_in_your_tests_as_you_do_in_your_code">Take Pride in Your Tests, as You Do in Your Code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the things that helps is to stop thinking of your tests as being an
incidental add-on to the "real" code, and to start thinking of them as being
a part of the finished product that you&#8217;re building&#8212;&#8203;a part that should be
just as finely polished, just as aesthetically pleasing, and a part you can
be justly proud of delivering&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So do it because the Testing Goat says so.  Do it because you know the payoff
will be worth it, even if it&#8217;s not immediate.  Do it out of a sense of duty,
or professionalism, or OCD, or sheer bloody-mindedness.  Do it because it&#8217;s
a good thing to practice.  And, eventually, do it because it makes software
development more fun.</p>

<p>This book wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the backing of my publisher,
the wonderful O&#8217;Reilly Media.  If you&#8217;re reading the free edition online,
I hope you&#8217;ll consider

don&#8217;t need one for yourself, then maybe as a gift for a friend?</p>
