Right up until <a href="/book/chapter_19.html">[isolation-chapter]</a>, almost all of the "unit" tests in
the book should perhaps have been called <em>integrated</em> tests, because they
either rely on the database, or they use the Django test client, which does too
much magic with the middleware layers that sit between requests, responses, and
view functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an argument that a true unit test should always be isolated, because
it&#8217;s meant to test a single unit of software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some TDD veterans say you should strive to write "pure", isolated unit tests
wherever possible, instead of writing integrated tests.  It&#8217;s one of the
ongoing (occasionally heated) debates in the testing community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being merely a young whippersnapper myself, I&#8217;m only part way towards all the
subtleties of the argument. But in this chapter, I&#8217;d like to try and talk about
why people feel strongly about it, and try and give you some idea of when you
can get away with muddling through with integrated tests (which I confess I do
a lot of!), and when it&#8217;s worth striving for more "pure" unit tests.

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Isolated tests ("pure" unit tests) vs. integrated tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>The primary purpose of a unit test should be to verify the correctness
of the logic of your application.
An <em>isolated</em> test is one that tests exactly one chunk of code, and whose
success or failure does not depend on any other external code. This is what
I call a "pure" unit test:  a test for a single function, for example,
written in such a way that only that function can make it fail.  If the
function depends on another system, and breaking that system breaks our
test, we have an <em>integrated</em> test. That system could be an external
system, like a database, but it could also be another function which we
don&#8217;t control.  In either case, if breaking the system makes our test fail,
our test is not properly isolated, it is not a "pure" unit test.  That&#8217;s
not necessarily a bad thing, but it may mean the test is doing two jobs at
once.


</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Integration tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integration test checks that the code you control is integrated
correctly with some external system which you don&#8217;t control.
<em>Integration</em> tests are typically also <em>integrated</em> tests.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">System tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>If an integration test checks the integration with one external system,
a system test checks the integration of multiple systems in your
application&#8212;&#8203;for example, checking that we&#8217;ve wired up our database,
static files, and server config together in such a way that they all work.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Functional tests and acceptance tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>An acceptance test is meant to test that our system works from the point
of view of the user ("would the user accept this behaviour?").  It&#8217;s
hard to write an acceptance test that&#8217;s not a full-stack, end-to-end test.
We&#8217;ve been using our functional tests to play the role of both acceptance
tests and system tests.

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_thesis_unit_tests_are_superfast_and_good_besides_that">Thesis: Unit Tests Are Superfast and Good Besides That</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
One of the things you often hear about unit tests is that they&#8217;re much faster.
I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s actually the primary benefit of unit tests, but it&#8217;s worth
exploring the theme of speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_faster_tests_mean_faster_development">Faster Tests Mean Faster Development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other things being equal, the faster your unit tests run, the better.  To a
lesser extent, the faster <em>all</em> your tests run, the better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined the TDD test/code cycle in this book.  You&#8217;ve started to get a
feel for the TDD workflow, the way you flick between writing tiny amounts of
code, and running your tests.  You end up running your unit tests several times
a minute, and your functional tests several times a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, on a very basic level, the longer they take, the more time you spend
waiting for your tests, and that will slow down your development.  But
there&#8217;s more to it than that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_holy_flow_state">The Holy Flow State</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking sociology for a moment, we programmers have our own culture, and our
own tribal religion in a way. It has many congregations within it, such as the
cult of TDD to which you are now initiated.  There are the followers of vi and
the heretics of emacs. But one thing we all agree on, one particular spiritual
practice, our own transcendental meditation, is the holy flow state.  That
feeling of pure focus, of concentration, where hours pass like no time at all,
where code flows naturally from our fingers, where problems are just tricky
enough to be interesting but not so hard that they defeat us&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is absolutely no hope of achieving flow if you spend your time waiting
for a slow test suite to run.  Anything longer than a few seconds and you&#8217;re
going to let your attention wander, you context-switch, and the flow state is
gone.  And the flow state is a fragile dream. Once it&#8217;s gone, it takes at
least 15 minutes to live again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_slow_tests_don_t_get_run_as_often_which_causes_bad_code">Slow Tests Don&#8217;t Get Run as Often, Which Causes Bad Code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your test suite is slow and ruins your concentration, the danger is that
you&#8217;ll start to avoid running your tests, which may lead to bugs getting
through. Or, it may lead to our being shy of refactoring the code,
since we know that any refactor will mean having to wait ages while all the
tests run. In either case, bad code can be the result.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_we_re_fine_now_but_integrated_tests_get_slower_over_time">We&#8217;re Fine Now, but Integrated Tests Get Slower Over Time</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be thinking, OK, but our test suite has lots of integrated
tests in it&#8212;&#8203;over 50 of them, and it only takes 0.2 seconds to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But remember, we&#8217;ve got a very simple app. Once it starts to get more
complex, as your database grows more and more tables and columns, integrated
tests will get slower and slower.  Having Django reset the database between
each test will take longer and longer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_don_t_take_it_from_me">Don&#8217;t Take It from Me</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Gary Bernhardt, a man with far more experience of testing than me, put these
points eloquently in a talk called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k">Fast Test, Slow Test</a>. I encourage
you to watch it.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_and_unit_tests_drive_good_design">And Unit Tests Drive Good Design</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But perhaps more importantly than any of this, remember the lesson from
<a href="/book/chapter_19.html">[isolation-chapter]</a>.  Going through the process of writing good, isolated
unit tests can help us drive out better designs for our code, by forcing us
to identify dependencies, and encouraging us towards a decoupled architecture
in a way that integrated tests don&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_problems_with_pure_unit_tests">The Problems with "Pure" Unit Tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this comes with a huge "but". Writing isolated united tests comes with
its own hazards, particularly if, like you or I, we are not yet advanced
TDD&#8217;ers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_isolated_tests_can_be_harder_to_read_and_write">Isolated Tests Can Be Harder to Read and Write</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Cast your mind back to the first isolated unit test we wrote.  Wasn&#8217;t it ugly?
Admittedly, things improved when we refactored things out into the forms, but
imagine if we hadn&#8217;t followed through?  We&#8217;d have been left with a rather
unreadable test in our codebase.  And even the final version of the tests we
ended up with contain some pretty mind-bending bits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_isolated_tests_don_t_automatically_test_integration">Isolated Tests Don&#8217;t Automatically Test Integration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we saw a little later on, isolated tests by their nature only test the
unit under test, in isolation.  They won&#8217;t test the integration between
your units.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This problem is well known, and there are ways of mitigating it. But, as
we saw, those mitigations involve a fair bit of hard work on the part of
the programmer&#8212;&#8203;you need to remember to keep track of the interfaces
between your units, to identify the implicit contract that each component
needs to honour, and you need to write tests for those contracts as well
as for the internal functionality of your unit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_unit_tests_seldom_catch_unexpected_bugs">Unit Tests Seldom Catch Unexpected Bugs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unit tests will help you catch off-by-one errors and logic snafus, which are
the kinds of bugs we know we introduce all the time, so in a way we are
expecting them. But they don&#8217;t warn you about some of the more unexpected
bugs.  They won&#8217;t remind you when you forgot to create a database migration.
They won&#8217;t tell you when the middleware layer is doing some clever HTML-entity
escaping that&#8217;s interfering with the way your data is rendered&#8230;&#8203;something
like Donald Rumsfeld&#8217;s unknown unknowns?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mocky_tests_can_become_closely_tied_to_implementation">Mocky Tests Can Become Closely Tied to Implementation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally, mocky tests can become very tightly coupled with the implementation.
If you choose to use <code>List.objects.create()</code> to build your objects but your
mocks are expecting you to use <code>List()</code> and <code>.save()</code>, you&#8217;ll get failing tests
even though the actual effect of the code would be the same.   If you&#8217;re not
careful, this can start to work against one of the supposed benefits of having
tests, which was to encourage refactoring.  You can find yourself having to
change dozens of mocky tests and contract tests when you want to change an
internal API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that this may be more of a problem when you&#8217;re dealing with an API
you don&#8217;t control.  You may remember the contortions we had to go through
to test our form, mocking out two Django model classes and using <code>side_effect</code>
to check on the state of the world.  If you&#8217;re writing code that&#8217;s totally
under your own control, you&#8217;re likely to design your internal APIs so that
they are cleaner and require less contortions to test.</p>

<h4 id="_but_all_these_problems_can_be_overcome">But All These Problems Can Be Overcome</h4>

<h4 id="_correctness">Correctness</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want our application to be free of bugs&#8212;&#8203;both low-level logic errors,
like off-by-one errors, and high-level bugs like the software ultimately
should deliver what our users want.  We want to find out if we ever introduce
regressions which break something that used to work, and we want to find
that out before our users see something broken.  We expect our tests to
tell us our application is correct.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_clean_maintainable_code">Clean, Maintainable Code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want our code to obey rules like "YAGNI" and "DRY".  We want code that
clearly expresses its intentions, which is broken up into sensible components
that have well-defined responsibilities and are easily understood.  We expect
our tests to give us the confidence to refactor our application constantly,
so that we&#8217;re never scared to try and improve its design, and we would also
like it if they would actively help us to find the right design.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_productive_workflow">Productive Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we want our tests to help enable a fast and productive workflow.
We want them to help take some of the stress out of development, we want
them to protect us from stupid mistakes.  We want them to help keep us
in the "flow" state not just because we enjoy it, but because it&#8217;s highly
productive.  We want our tests to give us feedback about our work as quickly
as possible, so that we can try out new ideas and evolve them quickly.  And
we don&#8217;t want to feel like our tests are more of a hindrance than a help when
it comes to evolving our codebase.</p>

<h4 id="_evaluate_your_tests_against_the_benefits_you_want_from_them">Evaluate Your Tests Against the Benefits You Want from Them</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there are any universal rules about how many tests you should
write and what the correct balance between functional, integrated, and isolated

all of your tests and asking whether they are delivering the benefits you want,
you can make some decisions.</p>

<h3 id="_architectural_solutions">Architectural Solutions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

There are also some architectural solutions that can help to get the most
out of your test suite, and particularly that help avoid some of the
disadvantages of isolated tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mainly these involve trying to identify the boundaries of your system&#8212;&#8203;the points at which your code interacts with external systems, like
the database or the filesystem, or the Internet, or the UI&#8212;&#8203;and trying
to keep them separate from the core business logic of your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ports_and_adapters_hexagonal_clean_architecture">Ports and Adapters/Hexagonal/Clean Architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>



Integrated tests are most useful at the <em>boundaries</em> of a system&#8212;&#8203;at
the points where our code integrates with external systems, like a
database, filesystem, or UI components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, it&#8217;s at the boundaries that the downsides of test isolation and
mocks are at their worst, because it&#8217;s at the boundaries that you&#8217;re most
likely to be annoyed if your tests are tightly coupled to an implementation,
or to need more reassurance that things are integrated properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, code at the <em>core</em> of our application&#8212;&#8203;code that&#8217;s purely
concerned with our business domain and business rules, code that&#8217;s
entirely under our control&#8212;&#8203;this code has less need for integrated
tests, since we control and understand all of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So one way of getting what we want is to try and minimise the amount
of our code that has to deal with boundaries. Then we test our core business
logic with isolated tests and test our integration points with integrated
tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, in their book <a href="#GOOSGBT">Growing Object-Oriented
Software, Guided By Tests</a>, call this approach "Ports and Adapters" (see
<a href="#ports-and-adapters">Ports and Adapters (diagram by Nat Pryce)</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We actually started moving towards a ports and adapters architecture in
<a href="/book/chapter_19.html">[isolation-chapter]</a>, when we found that writing isolated unit tests was
encouraging us to push ORM code out of the main application, and hide it
in helper functions from the model layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This pattern is also sometimes known as "The Clean architecture" or "Hexagonal
Architecture".  See the further reading section at the end for more info.

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_functional_core_imperative_shell">Functional Core, Imperative Shell</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Gary Bernhardt pushes this further, recommending an architecture he calls
"Functional Core, Imperative Shell", whereby the "shell" of the application,
the place where interaction with boundaries happens, follows the imperative
programming paradigm, and can be tested by integrated tests, acceptance tests,
or even (gasp!) not at all, if it&#8217;s kept minimal enough. But the core of the
application is actually written following the functional programming paradigm
(complete with the "no side effects" corollary), which actually allows fully
isolated, "pure" unit tests, <em>entirely without mocks</em>.</p>
