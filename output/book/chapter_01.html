<p>TDD isn&#8217;t something that comes naturally. It&#8217;s a
discipline, like a martial art, and just like in a Kung Fu movie, you
need a bad-tempered and unreasonable master to force you to learn the
discipline.  Ours is the Testing Goat.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_obey_the_testing_goat_do_nothing_until_you_have_a_test">Obey the Testing Goat! Do Nothing Until You Have a Test</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Testing Goat is the unofficial mascot of TDD in the Python testing
community.  It probably means different things to different people, but, to me,
the Testing Goat is a voice inside my head that keeps me on the True Path of
Testing&#8212;&#8203;like one of those little angels or demons that pop up above your
shoulder in the cartoons, but with a very niche set of concerns. I hope, with
this book, to install the Testing Goat inside your head too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve decided to build a website, even if we&#8217;re not quite sure what it&#8217;s
going to do yet. Normally the first step in web development is getting
your web framework installed and configured. <em>Download this, install that,
configure the other, run the script</em>&#8230;&#8203;but TDD requires a different mindset.
When you&#8217;re doing TDD, you always have the Testing Goat inside you&#8212;&#8203;single-minded as goats are&#8212;&#8203;bleating &#8220;Test first, test first!&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In TDD the first step is always the same: <em>write a test</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>First</em> we write the test; <em>then</em> we run it and check that it fails as
expected.  <em>Only then</em> do we go ahead and build some of our app.  Repeat
that to yourself in a goat-like voice.  I know I do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing about goats is that they take one step at a time.  That&#8217;s why
they seldom fall off mountains, see, no matter how steep they are.  As you
can see in <a href="#tree_goat">Goats are more agile than you think (source: </a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caitlinstewart/2846642630/">Caitlin Stewart, on Flickr</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll proceed with nice small steps; we&#8217;re going to use <em>Django</em>, which is
a popular Python web framework, to build our app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing we want to do is check that we&#8217;ve got Django installed, and
that it&#8217;s ready for us to work with. The <em>way</em> we&#8217;ll check is by confirming
that we can spin up Django&#8217;s development server and actually see it serving up
a web page, in our web browser, on our local PC. We&#8217;ll use the <em>Selenium</em>
browser automation tool for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="first-FT" class="paragraph">
<p>Create a new Python file called <em>functional_tests.py</em>, wherever you want to
keep the code for your project, and enter the following code.  If you feel like
making a few little goat noises as you do it, it may help:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock sourcecode">
<div class="title">functional_tests.py</div>

<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="python"><span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="include">selenium</span> <span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="include">webdriver</span>

browser = webdriver.Firefox()
browser.get(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">http://localhost:8000</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>)

<span class="keyword">assert</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">Django</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> <span class="keyword">in</span> browser.title</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s our first <em>functional test</em> (FT); I&#8217;ll talk more about what I mean by
functional tests, and how they contrast with unit tests, in a bit.  For now, it&#8217;s enough
to assure ourselves that we understand what it&#8217;s doing:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Starting a Selenium "webdriver" to pop up a real Firefox browser window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using it to open up a web page which we&#8217;re expecting to be served from
the local PC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking (making a test assertion) that the page has the word "Django" in
its title</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s try running it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>python functional_tests.py</strong>
  File ".../selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py", line 309, in get
    self.execute(Command.GET, {'url': url})

    self.error_handler.check_response(response)

ut:neterror?e=connectionFailure&amp;u=http%3A//localhost%3A8000/[...]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see a browser window pop up and try to open <em>localhost:8000</em>, and
show the "Unable to connect" error page.  If you switch back to your console,
you&#8217;ll see the big ugly error message, telling us that Selenium hit
an error page. And then, you will probably be irritated at the fact that it
left the Firefox window lying around your desktop for you to tidy up.  We&#8217;ll
fix that later!</p>

<p>So many introductions to TDD use Roman numerals as an example that it&#8217;s a

find it on <a href="https://github.com/hjwp/tdd-roman-numeral-calculator/">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Roman numerals, as an example, are both good and bad.  It&#8217;s a nice &#8220;toy&#8221;
problem, reasonably limited in scope, and you can explain TDD quite well with
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that it can be hard to relate to the real world.  That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;ve decided to use building a real web app, starting from nothing, as my
example.  Although it&#8217;s a simple web app, my hope is that it will be easier
for you to carry across to your next real project.</p>

<h3 id="_getting_django_up_and_running">Getting Django Up and Running</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since you&#8217;ve definitely read &#8220;<a href="/book/pre-requisite-installations.html">[pre-requisites]</a>&#8221; by now, you&#8217;ve
already got Django installed.  The first step in getting Django up and running
is to create a <em>project</em>, which will be the main container for our site.
Django provides a little command-line tool for this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>django-admin.py startproject superlists</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That will create a folder called <em>superlists</em>, and a set of files and
subfolders inside it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>.
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472; functional_tests.py
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472; geckodriver.log
&#9492;&#9472;&#9472; superlists
    &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; manage.py
    &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; superlists
        &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; __init__.py
        &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; settings.py
        &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; urls.py
        &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; wsgi.py</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a folder called <em>superlists</em> inside a folder called
<em>superlists</em>.  It&#8217;s a bit confusing, but it&#8217;s just one of those things; there
are good reasons when you look back at the history of Django.  For now, the
important thing to know is that the <em>superlists/superlists</em> folder is for
stuff that applies to the whole project&#8212;&#8203;like <em>settings.py</em>, for example,
which is used to store global configuration information for the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll also have noticed <em>manage.py</em>. That&#8217;s Django&#8217;s Swiss Army knife, and
one of the things it can do is run a development server.  Let&#8217;s try that now.
Do a <strong><code>cd superlists</code></strong> to go into the top-level <em>superlists</em> folder (we&#8217;ll
work from this folder a lot) and then run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>

you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.

<p>Not much action on the command line, but you should notice two things: firstly,
there was no ugly <code>AssertionError</code> and secondly, the Firefox window that

<p>Well, it may not look like much, but that was our first ever passing test!
Hooray!</p>

<p>If it all feels a bit too much like magic, like it wasn&#8217;t quite real, why not
go and take a look at the dev server manually, by opening a web browser

<h3 id="_starting_a_git_repository">Starting a Git Repository</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s one last thing to do before we finish the chapter: start to commit our
work to a <em>version control system</em> (VCS).  If you&#8217;re an experienced programmer
you don&#8217;t need to hear me preaching about version control, but if you&#8217;re new to
it please believe me when I say that VCS is a must-have.  As soon as your
project gets to be more than a few weeks old and a few lines of code, having a
tool available to look back over old versions of code, revert changes, explore
new ideas safely, even just as a backup&#8230;&#8203;boy. TDD goes hand in hand with
version control, so I want to make sure I impart how it fits into the workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, our first commit! If anything it&#8217;s a bit late; shame on us. We&#8217;re using
<em>Git</em> as our VCS, &#8217;cos it&#8217;s the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start by moving <em>functional_tests.py</em> into the <em>superlists</em> folder, and
doing the <code>git init</code> to start the repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>ls</strong>
superlists  functional_tests.py  geckodriver.log
$ <strong>mv functional_tests.py superlists/</strong>
$ <strong>cd superlists</strong>
$ <strong>git init .</strong>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Our Working Directory from Now on Is the Top-Level <em>superlists</em> Folder</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this point onwards, the top-level <em>superlists</em> folder will be our working
directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(For simplicity, in my command listings, I&#8217;ll always show it as
<em>/&#8230;&#8203;/superlists/</em>, although it will probably actually be something like
<em>/home/kind-reader-username/my-python-projects/superlists/</em>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever I show a command to type in, it will assume we&#8217;re in this directory.
Similarly, if I mention a path to a file, it will be relative to this top-level
directory.  So <em>superlists/settings.py</em> means the <em>settings.py</em> inside the
second-level <em>superlists</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clear as mud? If in doubt, look for <em>manage.py</em>; you want to be in the same
directory as <em>manage.py</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look and see what files we want to commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>ls</strong>
db.sqlite3  manage.py   superlists  functional_tests.py</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>db.sqlite3</em> is a database file. We don&#8217;t want that in version control.  Earlier
we also saw <em>geckodriver.log</em>, which is a logfile from Selenium, which we don&#8217;t
want to track changes to either.  We&#8217;ll add both of them to a special file
called <em>.gitignore</em> which, um, tells Git what to ignore:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

$ <strong>echo "geckodriver.log" &gt;&gt; .gitignore</strong></pre>

<p>Next we can add the rest of the contents of the current folder, ".":</p>
