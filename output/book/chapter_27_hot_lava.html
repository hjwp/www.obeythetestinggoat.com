<p>

Almost all of the "unit" tests in the book
should perhaps have been called <em>integration</em> tests,
because they all rely on the database
or use the Django Test Client,
which does a lot of magic with the middleware layers that sit between requests,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an argument that a true unit test should be more fully isolated,
because it&#8217;s meant to test a single unit of software.
If it touches the database, it can&#8217;t be a unit test.
The database is hot lava!
As Casey Kinsey put it in a memorable DjangoCon talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we progress along our TDD journey,
particularly as our projects increase in complexity,
it becomes more important to strive to have more of our tests be
decoupled from external systems like the database,
and even from external dependencies like Django itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is often expressed as the "Test Pyramid",
whereby your test coverage is achieved with a large base of unit tests,
a smaller number of integration tests in the middle,
and a tiny number of functional tests at the top: <a href="#test_pyramid">The Test Pyramid</a>.</p>

<p>FTs check that the system works end-to-end,
exercising the full stack of the application,
including all dependencies and connected external systems.
They are the ultimate test that it all hangs together,
and that things are "really" going to work.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Integration tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>The purpose of an integration tests is to checks that the code
you write is integrated correctly with some "external" system or dependency.
Because all of our "unit" tests so far are integrated with the database,
they can be considered integration tests,
even if that&#8217;s not what we thought of as their primary purpose</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Unit tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unit tests are the lowest-level tests,
and are supposed to test a single "unit" of code or behaviour.
The ideal unit test is fully isolated
from everything external to the unit under test
such that changes to things outside cannot break the test.</p>

<h3 id="_whats_wrong_with_integration_or_functional_tests">What&#8217;s Wrong With Integration (or Functional) Tests?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do people aspire to the Test Pyramid, where the majority of tests are unit tests?
What&#8217;s wrong with integration tests and functional tests?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve seen that Django&#8217;s testing tools tend to push us towards writing integration tests.
The Django TestCase sets up a clean database for each test,
and the Django Test Client lets us interact with the full stack of our Django app,
from the HTTP layer all the way down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Involving the database in every single test starts to carry an unacceptable cost,
in terms of the speed of execution of nothing else;
Casey&#8217;s company was struggling with test suites that took several hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At PythonAnywhere, our functional test suite didn&#8217;t just rely on the database,
it would spin up a full test cluster of 6 virtual machines.
A full run used to take at least 12 hours,
and we&#8217;d have to wait overnight for our results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At Kraken, the full test suite does only take about 45 minutes,
but that&#8217;s only thanks to a quite frankly ridiculous level of parallelisation
and associated expenditure on CI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_whats_so_good_about_fast_tests">What&#8217;s so Good about Fast Tests?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I don&#8217;t think that speed is necessarily the most important benefit of unit tests,
but it&#8217;s worth exploring the theme.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_faster_tests_mean_faster_development">Faster Tests Mean Faster Development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other things being equal, the faster your unit tests run, the better.
To a lesser extent, the faster <em>all</em> your tests run, the better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined the TDD test/code cycle in this book.
You&#8217;ve started to get a feel for the TDD workflow,
the way you flick between writing tiny amounts of code and running your tests.
You end up running your unit tests several times a minute,
and your functional tests several times a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, on a very basic level, the longer they take, the more time you spend waiting
for your tests, and that will slow down your development.
But there&#8217;s more to it than that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_holy_flow_state">The Holy Flow State</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking sociology for a moment, we programmers have our own culture,
and our own tribal religion in a way.
It has many congregations within it
such as the cult of TDD to which you are now initiated.
There are the followers of vi and the heretics of emacs.
But one thing we all agree on, one particular spiritual practice,
our own transcendental meditation, is the holy flow state.
That feeling of pure focus, of concentration,
where hours pass like no time at all,
where code flows naturally from our fingers,
where problems are just tricky enough to be interesting
but not so hard that they defeat us&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is absolutely no hope of achieving flow
if you spend your time waiting for a slow test suite to run.
Anything longer than a few seconds and you&#8217;re going to let your attention wander,
you context-switch, and the flow state is gone.
And the flow state is a fragile dream.
Once it&#8217;s gone, it takes at least 15 minutes to live again.</p>

<h3 id="_what_do_we_want_from_our_tests_anyway">What Do We Want from Our Tests, Anyway?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Let&#8217;s step back and have a think about what benefits we want our tests to
deliver.  Why are we writing them in the first place?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_check_that_it_works_aka_correctness">"Check That It Works" AKA Correctness</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fundamental part of programming is that now and again
you need to check whether "it works".
Automated testing is the solution to the fact that checking things manually
quickly gets tedious, and unreliable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want our application to be free of bugs&#8212;&#8203;both low-level logic errors,
like off-by-one errors, and high-level bugs
like the software not ultimately delivering what our users want.
We want to find out if we ever introduce regressions
which break something that used to work,
and we want to find that out before our users see something broken.
We expect our tests to tell us our application&#8217;s behaviour is <em>correct</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_driving_clean_maintainable_code">Driving Clean, Maintainable Code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we&#8217;ve got code that works,
the next most important thing is that our code is easy to understand
and easy to change.
Tests help us to achieve this by giving us the confidence to refactor,
and TDD helps even more by forcing us to consider the design of our code
from the outside, before we write it.
But there is also something about the process of designing code <em>to be testable</em>
which, hopefully, arguably, leads to better design as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s really something that you only get from unit tests though,
and it&#8217;s not a topic we could explore in great detail in this book,
but, again, I do go into it in <a href="https://www.cosmicpython.com">Cosmic Python</a>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_productive_workflow">Productive Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we want our tests to help enable a fast and productive workflow.
We want them to help take some of the stress out of development,
and we want them to protect us from stupid mistakes.
We want them to help keep us in the "flow" state not just because we enjoy it,
but because it&#8217;s highly productive.
We want our tests to give us feedback about our work as quickly as possible,
so that we can try out new ideas and evolve them quickly.
And we don&#8217;t want to feel like our tests are more of a hindrance than a help
when it comes to evolving our codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TODO merge here</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally there&#8217;s the workflow aspect.
In this book we&#8217;ve seen how you can get into a fast flow,
with the unit-test/code cycle,
and we&#8217;ve seen several examples of how the tests can take some of the stress out of development,
how they can save us from making stupid mistakes,
and how they can act as reminders of where we&#8217;ve got to and what to do next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two other aspects to consider here,
the first is the speed of the feedback cycle:
the faster our tests can give us feedback about our code,
the more productive and agile we can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But we also want to make sure that our tests don&#8217;t ever become a <em>brake</em> on development.
When we want to evolve our codebase, we want to minimise the number
of makework changes that we need to make in our tests.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there are any universal rules about how many tests you should
write and what the correct balance between functional, integrated, and isolated

you can make some <span class="keep-together">decisions</span>.</p>

<h3 id="_architectural_solutions">Architectural Solutions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

There are also some architectural solutions
that can help to get the most out of your test suite,
and particularly that help avoid some of the disadvantages of isolated tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mainly these involve trying to identify the boundaries of your system&#8212;&#8203;the
points at which your code interacts with external systems,
like the database or the filesystem, or the internet, or the UI&#8212;&#8203;and
trying to keep them separate from the core business logic of your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ports_and_adaptershexagonalclean_architecture">Ports and Adapters/Hexagonal/Clean Architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integrated tests are most useful at the <em>boundaries</em> of a system&#8212;&#8203;at
the points where our code integrates with external systems, like a
database, filesystem, or UI components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, it&#8217;s at the boundaries that the downsides of test isolation and
mocks are at their worst, because it&#8217;s at the boundaries that you&#8217;re most
likely to be annoyed if your tests are tightly coupled to an implementation,
or to need more reassurance that things are integrated properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, code at the <em>core</em> of our application&#8212;&#8203;code that&#8217;s purely
concerned with our business domain and business rules, code that&#8217;s
entirely under our control&#8212;&#8203;has less need for integrated
tests, since we control and understand all of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So one way of getting what we want is to try to minimise the amount
of our code that has to deal with boundaries. Then we test our core business
logic with isolated tests and test our integration points with integrated
tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, in their book
<a href="/book/bibliography.html#GOOSGBT"><em>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</em></a>,
call this approach "Ports and Adapters" (see <a href="#ports-and-adapters">Ports and Adapters (diagram by Nat Pryce)</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This pattern is also sometimes known as the "clean architecture" or "hexagonal architecture".

<h4 id="_functional_core_imperative_shell">Functional Core, Imperative Shell</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gary Bernhardt pushes this further, recommending an architecture he calls
"Functional Core, Imperative Shell", whereby the "shell" of the application,
the place where interaction with boundaries happens, follows the imperative
programming paradigm, and can be tested by integrated tests, acceptance tests,
or even (gasp!) not at all, if it&#8217;s kept minimal enough. But the core of the
application is actually written following the functional programming paradigm
(complete with the "no side effects" corollary), which actually allows fully
isolated, "pure" unit tests, <em>entirely without mocks</em>.</p>
