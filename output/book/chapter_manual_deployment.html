your users are <em>actually</em> going to do with your site once they get their

they actually want to use it to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists, for

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deploying
a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.  Oft-heard is the
forlorn cry <em>"but it works on my machine!"</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some
of the danger areas of deployment include:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)</dt>
<dd>
<p>    Web
servers usually need special configuration for serving these.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">The database</dt>
<dd>
<p>There can be permissions and path issues, and we need to be careful about
preserving data between deploys.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>We need to make sure that the packages our software relies on are installed
on the server, and have the correct versions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there are solutions to all of these.  In order:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using a <em>staging site</em>, on the same infrastructure as the production site,
can help us test out our deployments and get things right before we go to
the "real" site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also <em>run our functional tests against the staging site</em>. That will
reassure us that we have the right code and packages on the server, and
since we now have a "smoke test" for our site layout, we&#8217;ll know that the
CSS is loaded correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just
like on our own PC, a <em>virtualenv</em> is useful on the server for
    managing packages and dependencies when you might be running more than one
    Python <span class="keep-together">application</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And
finally, <em>automation, automation, automation</em>.  By using an automated
    script to deploy new versions, and by using the same script to deploy to
    staging <span class="keep-together">and production</span>, we can reassure ourselves that staging is as much
    like live as
    <span class="keep-together">possible</span>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Over the next few pages I&#8217;m going to go through <em>a</em> deployment procedure.  It

<p>Let&#8217;s

If you don&#8217;t already own a domain, this is the time to register one! Again,
this is something I really want you to <em>actually</em> do.  If you&#8217;ve never
registered a domain before, just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one&#8212;&#8203;it

<h3 id="_manually_provisioning_a_server_to_host_our_site">Manually Provisioning a Server to Host Our Site</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We
can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Provisioning</em> a new server to be able to host the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Deploying</em> a new version of the code to an existing server</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people like to use a brand new server for every deployment&#8212;&#8203;it&#8217;s what we
do at PythonAnywhere.  That&#8217;s only necessary for larger, more complex sites
though, or major changes to an existing site. For a simple site like ours, it
makes sense to separate the two tasks.  And, although we eventually want both
to be completely automated, we can probably live with a manual provisioning
system for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you go through this chapter, you should be aware that provisioning is
something that varies a lot, and that as a result there are few universal
best practices for deployment.  So, rather than trying to remember the
specifics of what I&#8217;m doing here, you should be trying to understand the
rationale, so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the
specific future circumstances you encounter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_choosing_where_to_host_our_site">Choosing Where to Host Our Site</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There
are loads of different solutions out there these days, but they broadly
fall into two camps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist pagebreak-before">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Running your own (possibly virtual) server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) offering like Heroku, OpenShift, or
<span class="keep-together">PythonAnywhere</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Particularly
for small sites, a PaaS offers a lot of advantages, and I would
definitely recommend looking into them.  We&#8217;re not going to use a PaaS in this
book however, for several reasons.  Firstly, I have a conflict of interest, in
that I think PythonAnywhere is the best, but then again I would say that
because I work there.  Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot&#8212;&#8203;learning about one doesn&#8217;t
necessarily tell you about the others. Any one of them might change their
process radically, or simply go out of business by the time you get to read
this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, we&#8217;ll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and web server config.  They&#8217;re unlikely to ever go away, and
knowing a bit about them will get you some respect from all the grizzled
dinosaurs out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I have done is to try to set up a server in such a way that it&#8217;s a lot
like the environment you get from a PaaS, so you should be able to apply the
lessons we learn in the deployment section, no matter what provisioning
solution you choose.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to
dictate how you do this&#8212;&#8203;whether you choose Amazon AWS, Rackspace, Digital
Ocean, your own server in your own data centre or a Raspberry Pi in a cupboard
under the stairs, any solution should be fine, as long as:</p>

<p>    For

your database configuration, static files, software dependencies, and
