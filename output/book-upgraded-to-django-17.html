        <div>
            <p>In a (futile) attempt to future-proof the book, I decided to upgrade it to
Django 1.7. Here's how that went down.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the biggest change was to do with migrations.  Like any new
change, my initial reaction was dislike, and I resented the new things, but I
think overall it's a definite improvment.</p>
<p>In brief, here's what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The new migrations framework means 'any' change to models needs a migration,
  or tests won't pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This meant introducing the concept of migrations much earlier in the book; 
  in fact, at the same time as I introduce the ORM.  I resented this because
  it made the learning curve of the book steeper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, because the new version of migrations essentially forces
  you to have them from the very beginning, I was able to drop an entire 
  chapter that was devoted to retrospectively building migrations after the
  first deployment, which included all sorts of checking out of old versions,
  and using <code>--fake</code>, and so on.  So that's a big win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using step-by-step TDD also forces you to make more migrations than you really
  want to, if you're adding fields and constraints step-by-step.  It means I have
  to introduce the reader early on to the idea of replacing existing migrations
  too, another steepening of the learning curve.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's some detail on the changes.</p>
<h2>Migrations make the introduction of <em>models.py</em> more complex</h2>
<p>In chapter 5, where we build the first model, the narrative used to go:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test </li>
<li>See it fail</li>
<li>Add code in <em>models.py</em>, step by step</li>
<li>Get the tests further, see a different failure</li>
<li>Add more code in <em>models.py</em></li>
<li>Get the tests passing</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test </li>
<li>See it fail</li>
<li>Add code in <em>models.py</em>, step by step</li>
<li>See a database error</li>
<li>Create a migration</li>
<li>See the tests get further, see a different failure</li>
<li>Add more code in <em>models.py</em></li>
<li>See a database error</li>
<li>Explain the concept of squashing migrations into one</li>
<li>Delete the existing migration and re-create it. </li>
<li>See the tests pass</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can see it's more complicated.  On the other hand, understanding
how Django gets from <em>models.py</em> to the database is important.  I had been
just hand-waving and saying "use syncdb, and just delete the database if
anything goes wrong", so maybe it's better to address this stuff head-on,
rather than wait for a complicated later chapter.</p>
<p>If you're curious, you can <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/ch05.html#_the_django_orm_amp_our_first_model">view the whole narrative here</a></p>
<p><em>(If you're a Django core developer and you're reading this, I'd love to
hear your thoughts btw.  There's a few weeks before the book goes to print
yet, so there's still time to tell me I'm doing it all wrong!)</em></p>
<p>I still kinda wish I could have kept my nice shallow learning curve - 
I expended a lot of effort with the book, in trying to make sure concepts
are introduced one at a time and gradually, and now I feel I'm slightly
forced to lump two concepts onto the reader at the same time.  But, there's
clearly an upside.</p>
<h2>But they save me from a fairly horrible chapter 13...</h2>
<p>It was always going to be an unlucky chapter wasn't it.  Because I'd 
glossed over the concept of migrations until then, I would get the
readers to deploy their code to a server in chapter 8 or so, and
then code some new stuff, including a new database feature.</p>
<p>Then I had a chapter 13 in which we would try and deploy to the staging
site, and see the new feature wouldn't work.  So then I had to explain
migrations, and go through this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the old commit that matches the point at which we did the last
   deployment, and check out the old version of <em>models.py</em> from it.</li>
<li>Do a <code>manage.py schemamigration</code>, and create a migration to match live</li>
<li>Check out the latest version of <em>models.py</em>, and do another <code>schemamigration</code>
   to get the migration we want to apply.</li>
<li>Test it out locally.  Check out the old <em>models.py</em> again, delete the databse,
   syncdb, then run <code>migrate 0001 --fake</code>, then check out the new code, and
   run <code>migrate</code>, check it works</li>
<li>Adjust the deploy script to include <code>migrate 0001 --fake</code> followed by a <code>migrate</code></li>
<li>Test deploying to staging... OK</li>
<li>Deploy to live</li>
<li>And, don't forget to now remove the <code>migrate 001 --fake</code> from your deploy 
   script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ouch! Quite a lot of pain there!  Especially when you consider that the new
procedure is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the deploy script.  It just works, because we've had migrations all
   along.</li>
</ol>
<p>:-)</p>
<h2>Other thoughts.</h2>
<p>I found the fact that tests would fail if you didn't have migrations intriguing,
but unfortunately it's not something you can rely on.  For example, in chapter
12 I introduce a <code>unique_together</code> constraint and test it thusly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_duplicate_items_are_invalid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">list_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">Item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">list_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;bla&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertRaises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ValidationError</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">item</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Item</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">list_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;bla&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">full_clean</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get that passing, I just add my <code>unique_together</code> constraint:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Item</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TextField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="nb">list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">unique_together</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;list&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;text&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And at this point <em>Django doesn't warn me that I need a migration</em>, because
the test is actually happening at the validation layer.</p>
<p>I think that's a bit of a shame, but there's probably nothing to be done about
it.  It's all because the concepts of data validation and database integrity
constraints are separate in Django, even though their implementation in 
<em>models.py</em> actually often happens in a single place...</p>
