        <div>
            <p>tl;dr: I think there's a real danger that striving for an ultrafast test suite,
will lead you to overly mocky, disjointed tests which don't help you
catch bugs and don't help you code well.</p>
<p>At this year's DjangoCon, Casey Kinsey gave a talk in which he (at least
ostensibly) advocated striving for faster test suites.  As we'll find out, I've
often thought that striving for fast tests suites can be a bit misguided, so I
went along preparing to disagree loudly -- as anyone who knows me can attest,
disagreeing loudly is just about my favourite thing to do, and a major
character flaw.</p>
<p>As it turns out I found very little to disagree with, aside from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cordiskinsey/djangocon-2013-how-to-write-fast-and-efficient-unit-tests-in-django/22">one
particularly tortured use of a Mock object</a>
which definitely made baby test sanity Jesus cry.  It was an excellent talk, 
and full of good advice, as well as the memorable quote <em>"The Database is Hot
Lava"</em></p>
<p>But, is it?</p>
<h2>The traditional argument: slow tests are bad</h2>
<p>Here's the traditional argument for fast tests:</p>
<p>Tests that take ages to run won't get run, which will break your development
process in several ways, and reduce the benefits you get from testing.  You
won't pick up defects early, because no-one is running the full test suite
before committing, and you won't be able to get the secondary benefit which 
you hope to gain from TDD, which is better designed code, because you can't
do TDD with slow tests.</p>
<p>The reference for this point of view is Gary Bernhardt's talk from Pycon
2013, entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k">Fast Tests, Slow test</a>
If you haven't already, I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to watch that talk, Gary 
knows what he's talking about, whereas I suspect I don't.</p>
<p><em>update 2013-09-17</em> -- everyone should also watch Gary's follow-up talk, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOYal8elnZk">Boundaries</a> in which he 
expands on the concepts of test isolation, and how it fits with trying to adopt
a more functional paradigm in the core business logic of your application.</p>
<h2>Why I think this is wrong: fast tests don't help you code, and they don't help you find bugs</h2>
<p>I'm being deliberately provocative here, and this is a bit of a strawman, but
I think the problem with turning slow tests into fast tests is that you end
up with worse tests.  Why is that?</p>
<ul>
<li>faster tests mean more "unittey" tests -- tests with less dependencies</li>
<li>that means using more mocks</li>
<li>that leads to a very granular tests, which are highly decoupled from each
other</li>
<li>and that, ultimately, doesn't help you find unexpected bugs</li>
<li>and it doesn't help you find regressions when you're refactoring either</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's look at an example. Imagine our site does a bit of setup for each
user: it makes a temp folder for them, and then sets a flag on their user
profile:</p>
<p>Imagine this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">setup_user_environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">setup_temp_storage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">profile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_profile</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">profile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environment_setup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
    <span class="n">profile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here's the kind of test I'm inclined to write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_sets_up_temp_storage_and_sets_flag_on_profile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;jim&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">setup_user_environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertTrue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/tmp/jim&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertTrue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_profile</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environment_setup</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Arg!  That's not a unit test at all!  It touches the database, which is hot
lava! Worse still, it touches the filesystem!  It'll be really slow!  And it
has too many dependencies!</p>
<p>That, at least, is what the purists would say.  They would prefer a "fast",
test that looks like this - a "real" unit test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_calls_setup_temp_storage_and_sets_flag_on_profile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">mock_user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;myapp.setup_temp_storage&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">mock_setup_temp_storage</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">setup_user_environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mock_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">mock_setup_temp_storage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_once_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mock_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">mock_profile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock_user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_profile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">return_value</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mock_profile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environment_setup</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well, I would argue that you have a much less readable test there, and it's
also a test that's very closely coupled to the implementation.  It discourages
refactoring, because something as simple as changing the name of the helper
method <code>setup_temp_storage</code> involves changing the test code in 4 places --
three of which (eg <code>mock_setup_temp_storage</code>) won't be found by automated
refactoring tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMO, there's no point in a test that duplicates the implementation, line
for line, with a series of mocks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine I change <code>setup_temp_storage</code> to take a username instead of a user.
I go and find its unit tests and change it, then change its implementation.
What will happen next is that <em>my</em> unit test for <code>setup_user_environment</code> would
break, because it uses the real function, and so that's my reminder to change
the place it gets used. </p>
<p>In contrast, in the "fast" test, <code>setup_user_environment</code> is mocked, so that
test will still pass, even though my code is broken.</p>
<p>Sure you could argue that my <code>os.path.exists</code> call is tightly coupled to the
implementation of <code>setup_temp_storage</code>, and that if I end up using it in lots
of tests, they'll be annoying to change, if I ever change the location of temp
storage, for example.  But I could factor it out into a test helper method, if
I notice myself duplicating test code a lot.</p>
<h2>What is the correct balance of unit to integration tests?</h2>
<p>Now unit test purists and I would probably agree that this example doesn't
prove you should <em>never</em> mock anything, or that "proper" unit tests are
useless.  Clearly, both are useful, and as my example clearly shows, you
definitely need some level of integration tests to check that all your pieces
fit together.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that, in a case where you can test a piece of code with
either a mocky or a non-mocky test, I prefer non-mocky tests.  Gary Bernhardt
says you should aim for 90% unit tests vs 10% "integration" tests (which is
what you'd call the kind of test I write), and I tend to think the ratio is
more like 50/50.</p>
<p>Unit tests are definitely better for nailing down code which has lots of edge
cases and possible logical pitfalls -- like the classic example of a roman
numeral converter.  But my assertion is: in web development, that kind of code
is rare:</p>
<ul>
<li>helper methods on models tend to be quite simple</li>
<li>view functions tend to be simple:  get a post request, instantiate a form,
  save a database item if the form validates and redirect, return a template
  with errors if not</li>
<li>code tends to be hard to unit test without mocking -- the database, the
  Django request/response stack, or the template layer, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've just tended to find that there aren't many places where I find myself
spelling out more than 2 or 3 tests for any given function -- in which case, I
tend to find, unit tests don't offer any substantial advantage.  In the example
above, there's probably only one two cases, maybe a second one for the case
where <code>setup_temp_storage</code> raises an exception.</p>
<p>But what about the fact that integration tests are slow?  The database is hot
lava!  Isn't it?</p>
<h2>The database is, at worst, lukewarm lava</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>NB - this is Django-specific</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, Django uses an <em>in-memory</em> Sqlite database when you're running its
unit tests. It's pretty fast.  Here's a test suite which hits the DB for some
tests and not for others, with 1,000 tests of each:</p>

<p>A factor of 3.  YMMV. At most one order of magnitude, but certainly not two
orders of magnitude. And notice that's 1000 tests, still running in less than a
second. So, is shifting from tests that run in microseconds to tests that run
in tens of microseconds <em>really worth</em> all the losses in terms of readability
and ease of refactoring?</p>
<h2>Unsurprisingly, it's all down to your own circumstances</h2>
<p>I think we all have a tendency to take the solutions we've applied to our own
particular circumanstances, and want to generalise them to universal rules,
saying they should apply to everybody.</p>
<p>Casey's team didn't have a CI setup, so their only way of preventing
regressions was for the individual developer to run the full suite before
checking in code. Their test suite was taking 45 minutes to run, leading to
developers skipping the test run and checking in broken code. You might argue
that their real problem was a problem of process, but they couldn't fix that,
so instead they put effort into making their tests faster, and in the process
made them more efficient and better, so it was a win for them.</p>
<p>At work, we have also have a unit test suite that takes 45 minutes to run (many
of the tests aren't very unittey, and are in fact very integrationey).  So
there's no way that we run all the unit tests as we do TDD (which we do for
everything).  Instead, we run a subset of the tests (usually the Django app
we're working on), and we leave the CI system to run the full unit test suite
overnight.</p>
<p>And you know what? <em>The full unit test suite almost never picks up any bugs</em>.</p>
<p>That's because our code is well compartmentalised, and, even though they're not
very unit-ey unit tests, they are still quite granular and independent from
each other.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a suite of 400-odd <em>functional</em> tests that run with Selenium;
these are definitely integration/system tests, or what some people would 
call acceptance tests. They check every part of the application -- and they
<em>do</em> find unexpected bugs. They take about 8 hours for a full run, so you bet
we only run one or two individual FTs during day-to-day TDD.</p>
<p>Now, we're building a PaaS, so we have a lot of what Gary B. would call
"boundaries" - a lot of dependencies on external systems: the filesystem, the
database (we run a shared-hosting database-as-a-service too), Tornado +
websockets, Paypal, Dropbox, github, pypi, linux chroots and cgroups, CRON,
Nginx and uWSGI, and many more.  There's a lot of moving parts, and ultimately
the only thing that's going to reassure us that everything really works is a
full-stack test.</p>
<p>So that's what works for us.  We are pretty much forced to have a lot of slow
tests, so maybe I'm just trying to justify our own specific circumstances and
try and force a generalisation onto the world.</p>
<h2>My turn to generalise from my own circumstances!</h2>
<p>But I'm not so sure.  I really think there's something to it.  I think you
really do lose a lot from using mocks everywhere, and I think that the price
you pay in terms of test speed is sometimes worth paying if you want more
"realistic" tests.</p>
<p>I would say this:  don't optimise prematurely.  Start by writing tests in the
way that seems most obvious to you, tests that are as readable as possible, 
and don't couple themselves too tightly to the implementation with a lot of
mocks.  If test speed becomes a problem at some point down the road, there
are plenty of smart people out there that will give you tips on how to speed
them up -- just remember that mocky unit tests don't really test your
application, so you'll need to keep a few end-to-end tests in there no matter
what.</p>
<p>Over to you folks!  I'm far from an expert, have only been writing tests for
about 3 years, and all for the same company.  Have you ever been bitten by
a bug because your tests were too mocky?  What ratio of unit tests to
integration tests works for you?</p>

    This is my <a href="http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com">old TDD tutorial</a>,
